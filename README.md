## Description
In this study we have investigated a natural river in the North-East of Québec that was dammed with 3 reservoirs over 3 years.
This unique setting allows us to investigate how microbial communities respond to shifts in residence time in their DNA and RNA.
Furthermore, we have sampled a continuum from soil, soilwater, streams, river, reservoirs until the estuary.
By covering a large spatial and ecological gradient we are able to decipher how microbial communities move and respond along a landscape.
