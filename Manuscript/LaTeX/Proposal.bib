abstract = {Abstract: A better understanding is needed of how hydrological and biogeochemical processes control dissolved organic car- bon (DOC) concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition from headwaters downstream to large rivers. We exam- ined a large DOM dataset from the National Water Information System ofthe US Geological Survey, which represents approximately 100 000 measurements ofDOC concentration and DOM composition at many sites along rivers across the United States. Application ofquantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization ofDOC concentrations and a shift from dominance ofaromatic DOM in headwaters to more aliphatic DOM downstream. The DOC concentration–discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero. We propose that despite complexities in river networks that have driven many revisions to the River Continuum Concept, rivers show a tendency towards chemostasis (C-Qslope ofzero) because ofa downstream shift from a dominance ofhydrologic drivers that connect terrestrial DOMsources to streams in the headwaters towards a dominance ofinstream and near-stream biogeochemical processes that result in preferential losses ofaromatic DOM and preferential gains ofaliphatic DOM.

abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria perform two major functions in the transformation of organic matter: They produce new bacterial biomass (bacterial secondary production [BP]), and they respire organic C to inorganic C (bacterial respiration [BR]). For planktonic bacteria, a great deal has been learned about BP and its regulation during the past several decades but far less has been learned about BR. Our lack of knowledge about BR limits our ability to understand the role of bacteria in the carbon cycle of aquatic ecosystems. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the amount of new bacterial biomass produced per unit of organic C substrate assimilated and is a way to relate BP and BR: BGE = (BP)/(BP + BR). Estimates of BGE for natural planktonic bacteria range from <0.05 to as high as 0.6, but little is known about what might regulate this enormous range. In this paper we review the physiological and ecological bases of the regulation of BGE. Further, we assemble the literature of the past 30 years for which both BP and BR were measured in natural planktonic ecosystems and explore the relationship between BGE and BP. Although the relationship is variable, BGE varies systematically with BP and the trophic richness of the ecosystem. In the most dilute, oligotrophic systems, BGE is as low as 0.01; in the most eutrophic systems, it plateaus near 0.5. Planktonic bacteria appear to maximize carbon utilization rather than BGE. A consequence of this strategy is that maintenance energy costs (and therefore maintenance respiration) seems to be highest in oligotrophic systems. [References: 170]},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and land use changes are causing major biodiversity losses. Connectivity of the landscape or environmental conditions alone can shape biodiversity patterns. In nature, however, local habitat characteristics are often intrinsically linked to a specific connectivity. Such a link is evident in riverine ecosystems, where hierarchical dendritic structures command related scaling on habitat capacity. We experimentally disentangled the effect of local habitat capacity (i.e., the patch size) and dendritic connectivity on biodiversity in aquatic microcosm metacommunities by suitably arranging patch sizes within river-like networks. Overall, more connected communities that occupy a central position in the network exhibited higher species richness, irrespective of patch size arrangement. High regional evenness in community composition was found only in landscapes preserving geomorphological scaling properties of patch sizes. In these landscapes, some of the rarer species sustained regionally more abundant populations better tracking their own niche requirements compared to landscapes with homogeneous patch size or landscapes with spatially uncorrelated patch size. Our analysis suggests that altering the natural link between dendritic connectivity and patch size strongly affects community composition and population persistence at multiple scales. The experimental results are demonstrating a principle that can be tested in theoretical metacommunity models and eventually be projected to real riverine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) interlinks large carbon reservoirs of soils, sediments and marine environments but remains largely uncharacterized on the molecular level. Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) has proven to be a powerful technique to reveal DOM chemodiversity and potential information encrypted therein. State-of the art FT-ICR MS (Ion Cyclotron Resonance) instruments are yet inaccessible for most researchers. To evaluate the performance of the most recent Orbitrap analyzer as a more accessible alternative, we compared our method to an established 15 Tesla FT-ICR MS on a diverse suite of 17 mainly terrestrial DOM samples regarding 1) ion abundance patterns, 2) differential effects of DOM type on information loss, and 3) derived biogeochemical information. We show that the Orbitrap provides similar information as FT-ICR MS, especially for compound masses below 400 m/z, and is mainly limited by its actual resolving power rather than its sensitivity. Ecosystems that are dominated by inputs of plant-derived material, like DOM from soil, bog, lake and rivers, showed remarkably low average mass to charge ratios, making them also suitable for Orbitrap measurements. The additional information gained from FT-ICR MS was highest in heteroatom-rich (N, S, P) samples from systems dominated by internal cycling, like DOM from groundwater and the deep sea. Here FT-ICR MS detected 37% more molecular formulae and 11% higher ion abundance. However, the overall information content, which was analyzed by multivariate statistical methods, was comparable for both data sets. Mass spectra-derived biogeochemical trends, for example the decrease of DOM aromaticity during the passage through terrestrial environments, were retrieved by both instruments. We demonstrate the growing potential of the Orbitrap as an alternative FTMS analyzer in the context of challenging analyses of DOM complexity, origin and fate.},

abstract = {Changes in the riparian vegetation along stream channels, diurnal light availability, and longitudinal fluctuations in the local light regime in streams influence primary production and carbon (C) cycling in benthic stream biofilms. To investigate the influence of light availability on the uptake dynamics of autochthonous and allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in benthic biofilms, we experimentally added C-13-labeled allochthonous DOC to biofilms grown under light intensities ranging from 5 to 152molphotonsm(-2)s(-1). We calculated the net C flux, which showed that benthic biofilms released autochthonous DOC across the entire light gradient. Light availability and diurnal light patterns influenced C uptake by benthic biofilms. More allochthonous DOC was respired under low light availability and at night, whereas under high light availability and during the day mainly autochthonous C was respired by the benthic biofilm community. Furthermore, phenol oxidase activity (indicative of allochthonous DOC uptake) was more elevated under low light availability, whereas beta-glucosidase activity (indicative of autochthonous DOC use) increased with light intensity. Collectively, our results suggest that biofilms exposed to high light inputs preferentially used autochthonous DOC, whereas biofilms incubated at attenuated levels showed greater use of allochthonous DOC. This has implications for the spatial dynamics of DOC uptake in streams and speaks against the occurrence of priming effects in algal-dominated stream biofilms.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the current understanding of the microbial diversity of bacterioplankton and its link to the biogeochemistry of the pelagic zone of aquatic ecosystems. During the last 2 decades, a large array of molecular approaches has been developed and applied to assess the diversity of bacterioplankton. One key result of the classical molecular approaches, such as commu-nity fingerprints and environmental clone libraries, is that the bacterioplankton community contains only a few abundant species and a large number of less abundant to rare members. This is in contrast to soil bacterial communities, where no abundant species are detected and the total number of species is substantially larger. New approaches, such as metagenomics and pyrosequencing, are discussed in terms of their ability to determine the diversity and abundance of the rare members of the community and the biogeochemical potential of the community. Several new approaches, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS), have been developed to study structure-function relationships of microbial communities. The combination of biogeochemical stimulation experiments with these functional and/or molecular approaches has the potential to elucidate the role of specific microorganisms concerning specific biogeochemical functions. These experimental analyses, together with in situ measurements of molecular and biogeochemical markers, enable the identification of key catalysts of pelagic biogeochemical processes and determination of their regulatory factors. Based on our current understanding of the structure-function links in bacterioplankton, we hypothesize that any local bacterial community comprises 2 parts: the abundant members form a core community that carries out the ongoing biogeochemical functions, and the rare members form a seedbank that provides the genetic potential to respond to any change in the system. Together, both parts form a pan community that is able to mediate the biogeochemical processes in the pelagic ecosystems of the earth. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Emergence of the metacommunity concept has made a substantial contribution to better understanding of the community composition and dynamics in a regional context. However, long-term field data for testing of available metacommunity models are still scarce, and the extent to which these models apply to the real world remains unknown. Tests conducted so far have largely sought to fit data on the entire regional set of species to one of several metacommunity models, implicitly assuming that all species operate similarly over the same set of sites. However, species differ in their habitat use. These differences can, in the most general terms, be expressed as a gradient of habitat specialization (ranging from habitat specialists to habitat generalists). We postulate that such differences in habitat specialization will have implications for metacommunity dynamics. Specifically, we predict that specialists respond more to local processes and generalists respond to regional spatial processes. We tested these predictions using natural microcosm communities for which long-term (nine-year) environmental and population dynamics data were available. We used redundancy analysis to determine the proportion of variation explained by environmental and spatial factors. We repeated this analysis to explain variation in the entire regional set of species, in generalist species only, and in specialists only. We further used ANOVA to test for differences in the proportions of explained variation. We found that habitat specialists responded primarily to environmental factors and habitat generalists responded mainly to spatial factors. Thus, from the metacommunity perspective, the dynamics of habitat specialists are best explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effects, while that of habitat generalists are best explained by patch dynamics and neutral models. Consequently, we infer that a natural metacommunity can exhibit complicated dynamics, with some groups of species (e.g., habitat specialists) governed according to environmental processes and other groups (e.g., habitat generalists) governed mainly by dispersal processes.},

abstract = {Bacterial communities are immensely diverse and drive many fundamental ecosystem processes. However, the role of bacterial community composition (BCC) for functioning is still unclear. Here we evaluate the relative importance of BCC (from 454-sequencing), functional traits (from Biolog Ecoplates) and environmental conditions for per cell biomass production (BPC; 3H-leucine incorporation) in six data sets of natural freshwater bacterial communities. BCC explained significant variation of BPC in all six data sets and most variation in four. BCC measures based on 16S rRNA (active bacteria) did not consistently explain more variation in BPC than measures based on the 16S rRNA-gene (total community), and adding phylogenetic information did not, in general, increase the explanatory power of BCC. In contrast to our hypothesis, the importance of BCC for BPC was not related to the anticipated dispersal rates in and out of communities. Functional traits, most notably the ability to use cyclic and aromatic compounds, as well as local environmental conditions, i.e. stoichiometric relationships of nutrients, explained some variation in all six data sets. In general there were weak associations between variation in BCC and variation in the functional traits contributing to productivity. This indicates that additional traits may be important for productivity as well. By comparing several data sets obtained in a similar way we conclude that no single measure of BCC was obviously better than another in explaining BPC. We identified some key functional traits for productivity, but although there was a coupling between BCC, functional traits and productivity, the strength of the coupling seems context dependent. However, the exact context is still unresolved.},

abstract = {Trait-based studies can help clarify the mechanisms driving patterns of microbial community assembly and coexistence. Here, we use a trait-based approach to explore the importance of rRNA operon copy number in microbial succession, building on prior evidence that organisms with higher copy numbers respond more rapidly to nutrient inputs. We set flasks of heterotrophic media into the environment and examined bacterial community assembly at seven time points. Communities were arrayed along a geographic gradient to introduce stochasticity via dispersal processes and were analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, and rRNA operon copy number was modeled using ancestral trait reconstruction. We found that taxonomic composition was similar between communities at the beginning of the experiment and then diverged through time; as well, phylogenetic clustering within communities decreased over time. The average rRNA operon copy number decreased over the experiment, and variance in rRNA operon copy number was lowest both early and late in succession. We then analyzed bacterial community data from other soil and sediment primary and secondary successional sequences from three markedly different ecosystem types. Our results demonstrate that decreases in average copy number are a consistent feature of communities across various drivers of ecological succession. Importantly, our work supports the scaling of the copy number trait over multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from cells to populations and communities, with implications for both microbial ecology and evolution.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 13 November 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.191.},

abstract = {Sequencing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is currently the method of choice for phylogenetic reconstruction, nucleic acid based detection and quantification of microbial diversity. The ARB software suite with its corresponding rRNA datasets has been accepted by researchers worldwide as a standard tool for large scale rRNA analysis. However, the rapid increase of publicly available rRNA sequence data has recently hampered the maintenance of comprehensive and curated rRNA knowledge databases. A new system, SILVA (from Latin silva, forest), was implemented to provide a central comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality controlled databases of aligned rRNA sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains. All sequences are checked for anomalies, carry a rich set of sequence associated contextual information, have multiple taxonomic classifications, and the latest validly described nomenclature. Furthermore, two precompiled sequence datasets compatible with ARB are offered for download on the SILVA website: (i) the reference (Ref) datasets, comprising only high quality, nearly full length sequences suitable for in-depth phylogenetic analysis and probe design and (ii) the comprehensive Parc datasets with all publicly available rRNA sequences longer than 300 nucleotides suitable for biodiversity analyses. The latest publicly available database release 91 (August 2007) hosts 547 521 sequences split into 461 823 small subunit and 85 689 large subunit rRNAs.},

abstract = {Glacier melting and altered precipitation patterns influence Arctic freshwater and coastal ecosystems. Arctic rivers are central to Arctic water ecosystems by linking glacier meltwaters and precipitation with the ocean through transport of particulate matter and microorganisms. However, the impact of different water sources on the microbial communities in Arctic rivers and estuaries remains unknown. In this study we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess a small river and its estuary on the Disko Island, West Greenland (69°N). Samples were taken in August when there is maximum precipitation and temperatures are high in the Disko Bay area. We describe the bacterial community through a river into the estuary, including communities originating in a glacier and a proglacial lake. Our results show that water from the glacier and lake transports distinct communities into the river in terms of diversity and community composition. Bacteria of terrestrial origin were among the dominating OTUs in the main river, while the glacier and lake supplied the river with water containing fewer terrestrial organisms. Also, more psychrophilic taxa were found in the community supplied by the lake. At the river mouth, the presence of dominant bacterial taxa from the lake and glacier was unnoticeable, but these taxa increased their abundances again further into the estuary. On average 23% of the estuary community consisted of indicator OTUs from different sites along the river. Environmental variables showed only weak correlations with community composition, suggesting that hydrology largely influences the observed patterns.},

abstract = {Microbial communities often exhibit incredible taxonomic diversity, raising questions regarding the mechanisms enabling species coexistence and the role of this diversity in community functioning. On the one hand, many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same energy-yielding metabolic functions, and this functional redundancy contrasts with the expectation that species should occupy distinct metabolic niches. On the other hand, the identity of taxa encoding each function can vary substantially across space or time with little effect on the function, and this taxonomic variability is frequently thought to result from ecological drift between equivalent organisms. Here, we synthesize the powerful paradigm emerging from these two patterns, connecting the roles of function, functional redundancy and taxonomy in microbial systems. We conclude that both patterns are unlikely to be the result of ecological drift, but are inevitable emergent properties of open microbial systems resulting mainly from biotic interactions and environmental and spatial processes.},

abstract = {Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the proportion of assimilated carbon that is converted into biomass and reflects the balance between growth and energetic demands. Often measured as an aggregate property of the community, BGE is highly variable within and across ecosystems. To understand this variation, we used a trait-based approach with 20 bacterial isolates enriched from lake communities to determine how consumer and resource identity affect BGE. We used phenotypic and genomic approaches to characterize the metabolic physiology of each isolate and test for predicted trade-offs between growth rate and efficiency. Across resource types, 20 % of the variation in BGE could be attributed to the coarse-scale taxonomic resolution of the isolate, while 58 % of the variation could be explained by isolate identity. Resource identity explained a relatively small amount of variation (7 %) in BGE across isolates but accounted for > 60 % of the variation within an isolate alone. Metabolic trade-offs and genomic features associated with BGE suggest that BGE is a species trait, which regardless of resource environment, contributes to variation in BGE. Genomic and phylogenetic information from microbiomes may help predict aggregate community functions such as BGE to better understand the fate of organic matter resources in ecosystems.},

abstract = {The high diversity of soil bacteria is attributed to the spatial complexity of soil systems, where habitat heterogeneity promotes niche partitioning among bacterial taxa. This premise remains challenging to test, however, as it requires quantifying the traits of closely related soil bacteria and relating these traits to bacterial abundances and geographic distributions. Here, we sought to investigate whether the widespread soil taxon Curtobacterium consists of multiple coexisting ecotypes with differential geographic distributions. We isolated Curtobacterium strains from six sites along a climate gradient and assayed four functional traits that may contribute to niche partitioning in leaf litter, the top layer of soil. Our results revealed that cultured isolates separated into fine-scale genetic clusters that reflected distinct suites of phenotypic traits, denoting the existence of multiple ecotypes. We then quantified the distribution of Curtobacterium by analysing metagenomic data collected across the gradient over 18 months. Six abundant ecotypes were observed with differential abundances along the gradient, suggesting fine-scale niche partitioning. However, we could not clearly explain observed geographic distributions of ecotypes by relating their traits to environmental variables. Thus, while we can resolve soil bacterial ecotypes, the traits delineating their distinct niches in the environment remain unclear.},

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

abstract = {The patterns of abundance generated by a simple stochastic birth-death-immigration model are described in order to characterize the diversity of neutral communities of ecologically equivalent species. Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance q approximately. The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal, skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always cause S to increase. Their effect on q approximately is more complicated, but given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q approximately will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals, equivalent to a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q approximately increase through time. Thus, a positive correlation between S and q approximately will usually be generated when sites of differing size or age are surveyed. At equilibrium, communities maintain roughly constant levels of S and q approximately but change in composition through time; composition may remain similar, however, for many generations. Many prominent patterns observed in natural communities can therefore be generated by a strictly neutral model. This does not show that community structure is determined exclusively by demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates the necessity for an appropriate null model when functional hypotheses are being tested.},

These taxa are retrievable with molecular techniques but are difficult to grow in culture. Second, there is a seed bank of many rare taxa that are not growing or grow extremely slowly, do not experience viral lysis and predation is reduced. Such taxa are seldom retrieved by molecular techniques but many can be grown in culture, which explains the dictum 'everything is everywhere'. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested two main predictions: that the correlation between community similarity and geographical distance (spatial distance decay) is stronger at the across-drainage than at the within-drainage system scale, and that spatial distance decay is strongest for zooplankton and weakest for bacteria. We used a combination of direct ordination, multivariate statistical tests, and distance-based approaches to examine spatial patterns in our data. Our analyses confirmed both of our predictions. Spatial distance decay was scale-dependent&semi; communities were overall weakly spatially structured within the drainage systems, yet distance decay was significant for all planktonic groups across drainage systems. Spatial distance decay was stronger for zooplankton, with higher slopes and shorter halving distances, than for phytoplankton and bacteria. These results provide evidence that distance decay of similarity is related to study scale, environment, and organism characteristics. Planktonic communities may be controlled by both dispersal-driven assembly and local ecological determinism, with the balance between these two forces depending on study scale.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important resource for microbes, thus affecting whole-stream metabolism. However, the factors influencing its chemical composition and thereby also its bio-availability are complex and not thoroughly understood. It was hypothesized that whole-stream metabolism is linked to DOM composition and that the coupling of both is influenced by seasonality and different land-use types. We tested this hypothesis in a comparative study on two pristine forestry streams and two non-forestry streams. The investigated streams were located in the Harz Mountains (central Europe, Germany). The metabolic rate was measured with a classical two-station oxygen change technique and the variability of DOM with fluorescence spectroscopy. All streams were clearly net heterotrophic, whereby non-forestry streams showed a higher primary production, which was correlated to irradiance and phosphorus concentration. We detected three CDOM components (C1, C2, C3) using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. We compared the excitation and emission maxima of these components with the literature and correlated the PARAFAC components with each other and with fluorescence indices. The correlations suggest that two PARAFAC components are derived from allochthonous sources (C1, C3) and one is derived autochthonously (C2). The chromophoric DOM matrix was dominated by signals of humic-like substances with a highly complex structure, followed by humic-like, fulfic acids, low-molecular-weight substances, and with minor amounts of amino acids and proteins. The ratios of these PARAFAC components (C1 : C2, C1 : C3, C3 : C2) differed with respect to stream types (forestry versus non-forestry). We demonstrated a significant correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and signals of autochthonously derived, low-molecular-weight humic-like substances. A positive correlation between P / R (i.e. GPP/daily community respiration) and the fluorescence index FI suggests that the amount of autochthonously produced DOM increased overall with increasing GPP. In accordance with the coupling between DOM and the metabolism, our data also indicate that the composition of DOM is subject to seasonal fluctuations.},

We designed seawater dilution Accepted Article experiments to assess the effect of pCO2 enrichment on heterotrophic bacterial community composition and metabolic potential in response to a pulse of phytoplankton-derived organic carbon. Experiments included treatments of elevated (1000 ppm) and low (250 ppm) pCO2, amended with 10 µmol L-1 dissolved organic carbon from Emiliana huxleyi lysates, and were conducted using surface-seawater collected from the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre. To assess differences in community composition and metabolic potential, shotgun metagenomic libraries were sequenced from low and elevated pCO2 treatments collected at the start of the experiment and following exponential growth. Our results indicate bacterial communities changed markedly in response to the organic matter pulse over time and was significantly affected by pCO2 enrichment. Elevated pCO2 also had disproportionate effects on the abundance of sequences related to proton pumps, carbohydrate metabolism, modifications of the phospholipid bilayer, resistance to toxic compounds and conjugative transfer.

abstract = {Lakes in the boreal region have been recognized as the biogeochemical hotspots, yet many questions regarding the regulators of organic matter processing in these systems remain open. Molecular composition can be an important determinant of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fate in freshwater systems, but many aspects of this relationship remain unclear due to the complexity of DOM and its interactions in the natural environment. Here, we combine ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) with kinetic modeling of decay of >1,300 individual DOM molecular formulae identified by mass spectrometry, to evaluate the role of specific molecular characteristics in decomposition of lake water DOM. Our data is derived from a 4 months microbial decomposition experiment, carried out on water from three Swedish lakes, with the set-up including natural lake water, as well as the lake water pretreated with UV light. The relative decay rate of every molecular formula was estimated by fitting a single exponential model to the change in FT-ICR-MS signal intensities over decomposition time.We found a continuous range of exponential decay coefficients (kexp)within different groups of compounds and show that for highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds the distribution of kexp was shifted toward the lowest values. Contrary to this general trend, plant-derived polyphenols and polycondensed aromatics were on average more reactive than compounds with an intermediate aromaticity. The decay rate of aromatic compounds increased with increasing nominal oxidation state of carbon, and molecular mass in some cases showed an inverse relationship with kexp in the UV-manipulated treatment. Further, we observe an increase in formulae-specific kexp as a result of the UV pretreatment. General trends in reactivity identified among major compound groups emphasize the importance of the intrinsic controllers of lake water DOMdecay. However, we additionally indicate that each compound group contained a wide spectrum of reactivities, suggesting that high resolution is needed to further ascertain the complex reasons behind DOM reactivity in lake water.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a central constituent of surface waters which control its characteristic color and chemistry. While the sources and controls of headwater stream DOC can be mechanistically linked to the dominant landscape types being drained, much remains unknown about the downstream controls at larger spatial scales. As DOC is transported from the headwaters to catchment outlets, the fate of stream DOC is largely dependent on the interaction of varying catchment processes. In this study, we investigated the main mechanisms regulating stream DOC in a mesoscale catchment. A landscape-mixing model was used to test the role of landscapes in determining stream concentrations. The quantity of DOC lost to in-stream processes was calculated using bacterial respiration and photooxidation rates. We investigated whether there was a change in water pathways using a mass balance model and comparison of hydrology between a headwater catchment and the entire catchment. A Monte Carlo approach was used to test robustness of the model assumptions and results to uncertainty in the process parameterizations. The results indicated that during high- and intermediate-flow conditions, DOC concentrations were regulated by the contributing upstream landscape types. During base flow, the connectivity between the mesoscale river and the upstream landscape reduced resulting in large residuals in the landscape model which could not be explained by the in-stream processes. Both the mass balance model and a specific runoff comparison between upstream/downstream sites independently indicated large input of deep groundwater during base flow. Deep groundwater was important for diluting stream DOC concentrations during base flow.},

abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth's surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

abstract = {The composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in rivers results from the different sources and in-stream transformations along the land to ocean aquatic continuum. Riverine DOM sources are highly dependent on the hydrological connection between the river channel and the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems, but how the lack of this connectivity (e.g., during drought episodes) affects the sources and biodegradation of DOM in rivers remains unclear. Here we identified the DOM sources as well as the different DOM pools that are respired along a Mediterranean river during drought by combining absorbance-fluorescence spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, biodegradation assays, and stable and radiocarbon isotopes. DOM composition was highly heterogeneous along the river in response to different sources and in-stream processes in each distinct aquatic environment (i.e., isolated water pools, running waters, and impounded waters in weirs). The reduced hydrological connectivity with terrestrial ecosystems promoted the influence of autochthonous DOM sources. Still, tree leaves from overhanging canopies stood out as an important terrestrial DOM source, especially in sites where water residence time was high such as isolated pools and weirs. Degradation of leaf leachates was a relevant process in these sites, whereas autochthonous DOM and groundwater millennial DOM (>1300 year B.P.) seemed to be degraded in running waters. Overall, our results highlight that the drought-induced hydrological disconnection entails a great spatial heterogeneity in the sources of DOM, which at the same time determines the different DOM pools that are respired in each environment along the river.},

abstract = {Phylogeny is an ecologically meaningful way to classify plants and animals, as closely related taxa frequently have similar ecological characteristics, functional traits and effects on ecosystem processes. For bacteria, however, phylogeny has been argued to be an unreliable indicator of an organism/'s ecology owing to evolutionary processes more common to microbes such as gene loss and lateral gene transfer, as well as convergent evolution. Here we use advanced stable isotope probing with 13C and 18O to show that evolutionary history has ecological significance for in situ bacterial activity. Phylogenetic organization in the activity of bacteria sets the stage for characterizing the functional attributes of bacterial taxonomic groups. Connecting identity with function in this way will allow scientists to begin building a mechanistic understanding of how bacterial community composition regulates critical ecosystem functions.},

A regular phenology was repeated across years, implying that freshwater bacterial communities are more predictable in their dynamics than previously thought. Seasonal events, such as water column mixing and trends in water temperature, were most strongly related to BCC variation. Communities became progressively less similar across years between the months of May and September, when the lake was thermally stratified. Dissolved oxygen and nitrate + nitrite concentrations were highly correlated to BCC change within and across seasons. The relationship between BCC and seasonal drivers suggests that trajectories of community change observed over long time series will reflect large-scale climate variation.},

abstract = {A great challenge facing microbial ecology is how to define ecologically relevant taxonomic units. To address this challenge, we investigated how changing the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) influences the perception of ecological patterns in microbial communities as they respond to a dramatic environmental change. We used pyrosequenced tags of the bacterial V2 16S rRNA region, as well as clone libraries constructed from the cytochrome oxidase C gene ccoN, to provide additional taxonomic resolution for the common freshwater genus Polynucleobacter. At the most highly resolved taxonomic scale, we show that distinct genotypes associated with the abundant Polynucleobacter lineages exhibit divergent spatial patterns and dramatic changes over time, while the also abundant Actinobacteria OTUs are highly coherent. This clearly demonstrates that different bacterial lineages demand different taxonomic definitions to capture ecological patterns. Based on the temporal distribution of highly resolved taxa in the hypolimnion, we demonstrate that change in the population structure of a single genotype can provide additional insight into the mechanisms of community-level responses. These results highlight the importance and feasibility of examining ecological change in microbial communities across taxonomic scales while also providing valuable insight into the ecological characteristics of ecologically coherent groups in this system.},

Nevertheless, despite the large literature on the commonness and rarity of species inspired by these pioneering studies, some widespread empirical patterns of species abundance resist easy explanation(4). Notable among these is the observation(5) that in large assemblages there are more rare species than the log normal model predicts(6,7). Here we use a long-term (21-year) data set, from an estuarine fish community, to show how an ecological community can be separated into two components. Core species, which are persistent, abundant and biologically associated with estuarine habitats, are log normally distributed. Occasional species occur infrequently in the record, are typically low in abundance and have different habitat requirements; they follow a log series distribution. These distributions are overlaid, producing the negative skew that characterizes real data sets.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between prokaryotic traits and phylogeny is important for predicting and modeling ecological processes. Microbial extracellular enzymes have a pivotal role in nutrient cycling and the decomposition of organic matter, yet little is known about the phylogenetic distribution of genes encoding these enzymes. In this study, we analyzed 3058 annotated prokaryotic genomes to determine which taxa have the genetic potential to produce alkaline phosphatase, chitinase and beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase enzymes. We then evaluated the relationship between the genetic potential for enzyme production and 16S rRNA phylogeny using the consenTRAIT algorithm, which calculated the phylogenetic depth and corresponding 16S rRNA sequence identity of clades of potential enzyme producers. Nearly half (49.2%) of the genomes analyzed were found to be capable of extracellular enzyme production, and these were non-randomly distributed across most prokaryotic phyla. On average, clades of potential enzyme-producing organisms had a maximum phylogenetic depth of 0.008004-0.009780, though individual clades varied broadly in both size and depth. These values correspond to a minimum 16S rRNA sequence identity of 98.04-98.40%. The distribution pattern we found is an indication of microdiversity, the occurrence of ecologically or physiologically distinct populations within phylogenetically related groups. Additionally, we found positive correlations among the genes encoding different extracellular enzymes. Our results suggest that the capacity to produce extracellular enzymes varies at relatively fine-scale phylogenetic resolution. This variation is consistent with other traits that require a small number of genes and provides insight into the relationship between taxonomy and traits that may be useful for predicting ecological function.},

In this experimental study, we were able to demonstrate a direct link between community composition and ecosystem functioning in that differently structured aquatic bacterial communities differed in their degradation of terrestrially derived DOM. Although the same amount of carbon was processed, both the temporal pattern of degradation and the compounds degraded differed among communities. We, moreover, uncovered that low-molecular-weight carbon was available to all communities for utilisation, whereas the ability to degrade carbon of greater molecular weight was a trait less widely distributed. Finally, whereas the degradation of either low- or high-molecular-weight carbon was not restricted to a single phylogenetic clade, our results illustrate that bacterial taxa of similar phylogenetic classification differed substantially in their association with the degradation of DOM compounds. Applying techniques that capture the diversity and complexity of both bacterial communities and DOM, our study provides new insight into how the structure of bacterial communities may affect processes of biogeochemical significance.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 21 August 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.131.},

Here, we use a multifactorial microcosm experiment to test the conditions under which priming may be observed in freshwater ecosystems. We assessed the effect of pulse additions of three labile carbon sources (acetate, glucose, and cellobiose) on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption using water from lakes with different trophic states (eutrophic to oligotrophic and clear to brownwater lakes). We further analyzed the effect of nutrient availability and the role of attachment of cells to surfaces. Despite the range of conditions tested, we found no clear evidence of a priming effect on DOC degradation, indicating that priming in freshwater systems may be of limited importance.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. 2. Species sorting (i.e. species are ‘filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmen- tally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by ‘mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this differ- ence may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. 3. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. 4. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

abstract = {One sentence summary: Soil microorganisms live in complex pore spaces where nutrient heterogeneity and water dynamics play a fundamental role in shaping their ecology, diversity and functions at all scales. Editor: Staffan Kjelleberg ABSTRACT Soil, the living terrestrial skin of the Earth, plays a central role in supporting life and is home to an unimaginable diversity of microorganisms. This review explores key drivers for microbial life in soils under different climates and land-use practices at scales ranging from soil pores to landscapes. We delineate special features of soil as a microbial habitat (focusing on bacteria) and the consequences for microbial communities. This review covers recent modeling advances that link soil physical processes with microbial life (termed biophysical processes). Readers are introduced to concepts governing water organization in soil pores and associated transport properties and microbial dispersion ranges often determined by the spatial organization of a highly dynamic soil aqueous phase. The narrow hydrological windows of wetting and aqueous phase connectedness are crucial for resource distribution and longer range transport of microorganisms. Feedbacks between microbial activity and their immediate environment are responsible for emergence and stabilization of soil structure-the scaffolding for soil ecological functioning. We synthesize insights from historical and contemporary studies to provide an outlook for the challenges and opportunities for developing a quantitative ecological framework to delineate and predict the microbial component of soil functioning.},

abstract = {The microbial assemblages of Petit Saut reservoir and Sinnamary river (French Guiana, South America) were analyzed by biochemical analyses (pigments and specific fatty acids), and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Samples from a vertical profile in the reservoir and from a longitudinal profile downstream of the dam were analyzed and compared to a reference sample taken in the river, upstream of the reservoir. The distribution of bacterial populations could be explained by the physico-chemical conditions of the water and the hydrodynamics induced by the hydroelectric plant. Two bacterial {\OE}bio-filters¹ were detected by biochemical analyses: methanotrophs at the oxycline level and phototrophic green sulfur bacteria below the oxycline. A statistical analysis of the DGGE fingerprints obtained for each sample showed that the different stations could be related in a dendrogram in good agreement with their geographic location. We detected 53 bands in the bacterial DGGE fingerprints and 3 bands in the archaeal DGGE. The phylogenetic affiliation of the predominant DGGE bands was inferred by a comparative 16S rDNA partial sequence analysis (450 to 500 base pairs). Sequences obtained from the reservoir and the river were related to Proteobacteria ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$), Cyanobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, Cytophaga, Methanomicrobiaceae and Thermoplasmales. Thus, methanotrophs and green sulfur bacteria were detected, and bacteria involved in the iron biogeochemical cycle were also shown to be dominant. The 16S rDNA-based analysis indicated that new bacterial and archaeal lineages, not detected upstream of the dam, were present in the reservoir and that the microbial diversity of these assemblages was greater than previously described by biochemical analyses. Our data provide evidence that the former bacterial assemblage was completely modified by the impounding of the reservoir, in agreement with the different biogeochemical cycles established. Minor groups of bacteria became dominant in the reservoir while others disappeared, in adaptation to the new conditions induced by flooding of rain forest.},

abstract = {Introduction Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean is one of the largest active organic carbon reservoirs on earth. The major frac-tion of DOM is still chemically uncharacterized, and little is known about sources and cycling in the marine environment (Hedges 2002). The very low concentration of organic mole-cules dissolved in seawater compared with the huge amounts of inorganic salts is a major challenge in analytical chemistry. Through isolation of DOM, highly concentrated organic sam-ples with low salt content can be obtained, and different ana-lytical techniques can then be performed on these concentrates. Solid-phase extraction (SPE), using XAD resins, was established in the late 1970s and has been used often (e.g., Aiken et al. 1979, Lara and Thomas 1994, Dittmar et al. 2001). A sequential combination of different XAD resins retains up to 65% of phytoplankton-derived DOM (Lara and Thomas 1994). Unfortunately, the XAD resins used for the extraction of marine DOM are not available anymore. More recently, ultra-filtration with a 1-kDa cutoff has become a widely recognized method for the extraction of DOM (ultrafiltered DOM, or UDOM), isolating up to 30% of marine DOM (e.g., Amon and Benner 1996, Benner et al. 1997). The sequential combination of reversed osmosis and electrodialysis was recently used for a more efficient isolation of marine DOM (Vetter et al. 2007). However, the isolates still contain several hundred times more salt than DOC, which precludes detailed molecular character-ization. Prepacked cartridges and discs with silica-C18 sor-bents were used for the extraction of DOM from freshwater systems (e.g., Kim et al. 2003) and for the isolation of lignin from seawater (Louchouarn et al. 2000). A combination of ultrafiltration and SPE significantly increased the total extrac-tion yield for estuarine DOC to 70% (Simjouw et al. 2005). Abstract A simple protocol is presented for the solid-phase extraction of dissolved organic matter (SPE-DOM) from seawater using commercially prepacked cartridges. The method does not require major instrumentation and can be performed in the field. Modified styrene divinyl benzene polymer type sorbents (Varian PPL and ENV) and sorbents of a silica structure bonded with different hydrocarbon chains (Varian C8, C18, C18OH, and C18EWP) were considered. Except for C18OH, which heavily contaminated the samples, none of the sorbents leached significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrogen (DON). Samples from the North Brazil shelf with strong mixing gradients of terrigenous and marine DOM were used to compare the various sorbents. PPL was the most efficient—on average, 62% of DOC was recovered as salt-free extracts. C18 was found to be most efficient among the silica-based sorbents, but it showed only two-thirds of the extraction efficiency of PPL. As indicated by [ 1 H]NMR, C/N, and $\delta$ 13 C analyses, PPL extracted a more representative proportion of DOM than C18. Therefore, PPL was used for comparative studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Antarctica. From brackish marsh and river waters, 65% and 62% of total DOC, respectively, could be extracted. For purely marine DOM in Antarctica and the deep sea, the extraction efficiency was lower (43% on average). The efficiency of the new method to isolate marine DOM is better than or similar to highly laborious methods. A further advantage is the complete desalination of the sample. The isolation of a major DOM fraction, which is salt-free, offers many pos-sibilities to further characterize DOM by advanced analytical techniques.},

abstract = {The use of rRNA/DNA ratios derived from surveys of rRNA sequences in RNA and DNA extracts is an appealing but poorly validated approach to infer the activity status of environmental microbes. To improve the interpretation of rRNA/DNA ratios, we performed simulations to investigate the effects of community structure, rRNA amplification, and sampling depth on the accuracy of rRNA/DNA ratios in classifying bacterial populations as “active” or “dormant.” Community structure was an insignificant factor. In contrast, the extent of rRNA amplification that occurs as cells transition from dormant to growing had a significant effect ( P < 0.0001) on classification accuracy, with misclassification errors ranging from 16 to 28%, depending on the rRNA amplification model. The error rate increased to 47% when communities included a mixture of rRNA amplification models, but most of the inflated error was false negatives (i.e., active populations misclassified as dormant). Sampling depth also affected error rates ( P < 0.001). Inadequate sampling depth produced various artifacts that are characteristic of rRNA/DNA ratios generated from real communities. These data show important constraints on the use of rRNA/DNA ratios to infer activity status. Whereas classification of populations as active based on rRNA/DNA ratios appears generally valid, classification of populations as dormant is potentially far less accurate.},

abstract = {The neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events, coupled with limited dispersal, can account for many community properties, including the relative abundance distribution. There are important analogies between this model in ecology and a three-tiered hierarchy of models in evolution (Hardy Weinburg, drift, drift and selection). Because it invokes random processes and is used in statistical tests of empirical data, the neutral model can be interpreted as a specialized form of a null model. However, the application and interpretation of neutral models differs from that of standard null models in three important ways: 1) whereas most null models incorporate species-level constraints that are often associated with niche differences, the neutral model assumes that all species are functionally equivalent. 2) Null models are usually fit with constraints that are measured directly from the data set itself. In contrast, the neutral model requires parameters for speciation, extinction, and migration rates that are almost never measured directly, so their values must be guessed at or fitted. 3) Most important, null models are viewed as simple statistical descriptors: unspecified ''random'' forces generate variation in a simple model that excludes particular biological mechanisms (usually species interactions). Although the neutral model was originally framed as a null model, recent proponents of the neutral model have begun to treat it as a literal process-based description of community assembly. These differences lie at the heart of much of the recent controversy over the neutral model. If the neutral model is truly a process-based model, then its assumptions should be directly tested, and its predictions should be compared to those of an appropriate null model. Such tests are rarely informative, and most empirical data sets can be fit more parsimoniously to a simple log-normal distribution. Because unknown parameters in the neutral model must usually be guessed at or fit in ad-hoc ways, classical frequentist tests are compromised, and may be biased towards finding a good fit with the model. There has been little analysis of the potential for type I and type II errors in statistical tests of the neutral model. The neutral model has recently been proposed as a specific form of more general null models in biogeography (the mid-domain effect) and community ecology (species co-occurrence). In both cases, the neutral model is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the predictions of classic null models. However, because the important parameters in the neutral model can rarely be measured directly, it may be of limited value as a null hypothesis for empirical tests. Future progress may come from moving beyond dichotomous tests of neutral versus null models. Instead, the neutral model might be viewed as a mechanism that contributes to pattern along with other processes. Alternatively, the fit of data to the neutral model can be compared to the fit to other process-based models that are not based on neutrality assumptions. Finally, the neutral model can also be tested directly if its parameters can be estimated independently of the test data. However, these approaches may require more data than are often available. For these reasons, simple null model tests will continue to be important in the evaluation of the neutral model. The neutral model (Bell 2000, Hubbell 2001) has generated great interest and controversy among ecolo-gists. Some of these debates echo earlier controversies in the 1980s over null model analysis (Gotelli and Graves 1996). Indeed, Enquist et al. (2002) have claimed that the neutral model is nothing more or less than a null model. Yet there remains considerable confusion about whether the neutral theory is only a null model, can function as a null model, or is different from traditional null models. In this commentary, we review the similarities and differences between null and neutral models, and point out that a failure to clearly distinguish between them has been responsible for some of the controversy surround-ing neutral models.},

abstract = {Aquatic bacterial communities harbour thousands of coexisting taxa. To meet the challenge of discriminating between a ‘core' and a sporadically occurring ‘random' component of these communities, we explored the spatial abundance distribution of individual bacterioplankton taxa across 198 boreal lakes and their associated fluvial networks (188 rivers). We found that all taxa could be grouped into four distinct categories based on model statistical distributions (normal like, bimodal, logistic and lognormal). The distribution patterns across lakes and their associated river networks showed that lake communities are composed of a core of taxa whose distribution appears to be linked to in-lake environmental sorting (normal-like and bimodal categories), and a large fraction of mostly rare bacteria (94% of all taxa) whose presence appears to be largely random and linked to downstream transport in aquatic networks (logistic and lognormal categories). These rare taxa are thus likely to reflect species sorting at upstream locations, providing a perspective of the conditions prevailing in entire aquatic networks rather than only in lakes. Landscape-scale spatial abundance distributions discriminate core from random components of boreal lake bacterioplankton.

abstract = {Natural fires annually decimate up to 1% of the forested area in the boreal region of Quebec, and represent a major structuring force in the region, creating a mosaic of watersheds characterized by large variations in vegetation structure and composition. Here, we investigate the possible connections between this fire-induced watershed heterogeneity and lake metabolism and CO2 dynamics. Plankton respiration, and water-air CO2 fluxes were measured in the epilimnia of 50 lakes, selected to lie within distinct watershed types in terms of postfire terrestrial succession in the boreal region of Northern Quebec. Plankton respiration varied widely among lakes (from 21 to 211 mu g C L-1 day-1), was negatively related to lake area, and positively related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). All lakes were supersaturated in CO2 and the resulting carbon (C) flux to the atmosphere (150 to over 3000 mg C m2 day-1) was negatively related to lake area and positively to DOC concentration. CO2 fluxes were positively related to integrated water column respiration, suggesting a biological component in this flux. Both respiration and CO2 fluxes were strongly negatively related to years after the last fire in the basin, such that lakes in recently burnt basins had significantly higher C emissions, even after the influence of lake size was removed. No significant differences were found in nutrients, chlorophyll, and DOC between lakes in different basin types, suggesting that the fire-induced watershed features influence other, more subtle aspects, such as the quality of the organic C reaching lakes. The fire-induced enhancement of lake organic C mineralization and C emissions represents a long-term impact that increases the overall C loss from the landscape as the result of fire, but which has never been included in current regional C budgets and future projections. The need to account for this additional fire-induced C loss becomes critical in the face of predictions of increasing incidence of fire in the circumboreal landscape.},

AMF communities are diverse, but the factors which control their assembly in space and time remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of geographical distance, environmental heterogeneity and time in shaping AMF communities associated with Miscanthus giganteus (a perennial grass originating from south-east Asia) were determined over a 13 months period. In particular, the community was partitioned into core (abundant and persistent taxa) and satellite (taxa with low abundance and persistence) constituents and the drivers of community assembly for each determined. $\beta$-diversity was exceptionally low across the 140 m line transects, and there was limited evidence of geographical scaling effects on the composition of the core, satellite or combined communities. However, AMF richness and community composition changed over time associated with fluctuation within both the core and satellite communities. The degree to which AMF community variation was explained by soil properties was consistently higher in the core community than the combined and satellite communities, suggesting that the satellite community had considerable stochasticity associated with it. We suggest that the partitioning of communities into their core and satellite constituents could be employed to enhance the variation explained within microbial community analyses. },

@article{Murali2018,
abstract = {Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of “over classification” is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. IDTAXA's classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online ( http://DECIPHER.codes ).},

@article{Graham2014,
abstract = {Despite the central role of microorganisms in biogeochemistry, process models rarely explicitly account for variation in communities. Here, we use statistical models to address a fundamental question in ecosystem ecology: do we need to better understand microbial communities to accurately predict ecosystem function? Nitrogen (N) cycle process rates and associated gene abundances were measured in tropical rainforest soil samples collected in May (early wet season) and October (late wet season). We used stepwise linear regressions to examine the explanatory power of edaphic factors and functional gene relative abundances alone and in combination for N-cycle processes, using both our full dataset and seasonal subsets of the data. In our full dataset, no models using gene abundance data explained more variation in process rates than models based on edaphic factors alone, and models that contained both edaphic factors and community data did not explain significantly more variation in process rates than edaphic factor models. However, when seasonal datasets were examined separately, microbial predictors enhanced the explanatory power of edaphic predictors on dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and N2O efflux rates during October. Because there was little variation in the explanatory power of microbial predictors alone between seasonal datasets, our results suggest that environmental factors we did not measure may be more important in structuring communities and regulating processes in October than in May. Thus, temporal dynamics are key to understanding the relationships between edaphic factors, microbial communities and ecosystem function in this system. The simple statistical method presented here can accommodate a variety of data types and should help prioritize what forms of data may be most useful in ecosystem model development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To ask whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20 °C for seven weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion temperatures elevated from 6 to 20 °C), bacterial communities returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within 7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a major disturbance.},

abstract = {Seven strains with identical 16S rRNA genes affiliated with the Luna2 cluster (Actinobacteria) were isolated from six freshwater habitats located in temperate (Austria and Australia), subtropical (People's Republic of China), and tropical (Uganda) climatic zones. The isolates had sequence differences at zero to five positions in a 2,310-nucleotide fragment of the ribosomal operon, including part of the intergenic spacer upstream of the 16S rRNA gene, the complete 16S rRNA gene, the complete 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS1), and a short part of the 23S rRNA gene. Most of the few sequence differences found were located in the internal transcribed spacer sequences. Two isolates obtained from habitats in Asia and Europe, as well as two isolates obtained from different habitats in the People's Republic of China, had identical sequences for the entire fragment sequenced. In spite of minimal sequence differences in the part of the ribosomal operon investigated, the strains exhibited significant differences in their temperature response curves (with one exception), as well as pronounced differences in their temperature optima (25.0 to 35.6°C). The observed differences in temper-ature adaptation were generally in accordance with the thermal conditions in the habitats where the strains were isolated. Strains obtained from temperate zone habitats had the lowest temperature optima, strains from subtropical habitats had intermediate temperature optima, and a strain from a tropical habitat had the highest temperature optimum. Based on the observed temperature responses, we concluded that the strains investi-gated are well adapted to the thermal conditions in their home habitats. Consequently, these closely related strains represent different ecotypes adapted to different thermal niches. Many free-living bacterial, archaeal, and protist species have a cosmopolitan distribution and differ in this trait from almost all macroorganisms (9). Closely related strains of several mi-crobial species have been detected in distant habitats (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 26). For some free-living bacteria and archaea, re-stricted geographical distributions have been demonstrated for strains inhabiting rare, extreme environments (e.g., hot springs) (17, 24). These distributions might be a result of iso-lation of populations due to limited dispersal potential result-ing from small population sizes combined with the rare occur-rence of appropriate habitats separated by wide distances. In the case of free-living microorganisms inhabiting nonextreme environments, the existence of a restricted geographical distri-bution has rarely been demonstrated (6). For free-living mi-crobes easy dispersal and frequent population of appropriate habitats are assumed (2, 9). Intensive gene flux between hab-itats should prevent the isolation of populations. On the other hand, local adaptation of populations may prevent coloniza-tion of a habitat by less adapted competitors originating from an ecologically different habitat. It is not known, however, if free-living cosmopolitan microbial species consist of many lo-cally adapted populations or if they form a single global pop-ulation with intensive gene flux. Intraspecific differences in physiological and ecological traits are well known for free-living microorganisms (3, 14, 18, 21, 22, 23), but so far it has been shown only rarely that this intraspe-cific variation is linked to local adaptation. For instance, Broni-kowski et al. (5) demonstrated that there was a positive corre-lation between the optimal growth temperatures of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica strains and the body temperatures of their cold-blooded (turtles) or warm-blooded hosts (swine and squirrels). These findings indicate that there is local ad-aptation of members of the same species to thermal niches, which are different due to differences in the body temperatures of their hosts. In order to test for local adaptation in free-living bacteria, we isolated seven Actinobacteria strains with identical 16S rRNA gene sequences (genotype 1 strains) from freshwater habitats located in different climatic zones. These habitats pro-vide different thermal conditions; therefore, bacteria inhabit-ing these freshwater systems may be differently adapted. We investigated the thermal adaptation of six of the seven geno-type 1 strains and found pronounced differences in the thermal adaptation of the strains investigated. These differences reflect the different thermal conditions of the habitats from which the strains originated. Therefore, we concluded that the strains investigated represent different ecotypes adapted to different thermal niches.},

There was little to no trend in the virus-to-bacteria ratio with increasing trophy. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between relations in marine and freshwater systems. The virusto- bacteria ratio was significantly higher in freshwater (mode = 22.5) than marine environments (mode = 2.51, and there were significantly more bacteria per unit chlorophyll in our freshwater samples. We suggest that this difference is related to the increased dependence of freshwater bacteria on allochthonous material relative to marine systems, as well as the increased relative importance of photosynthetic cyanobacteria in lakes.},

An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

abstract = {High-throughput amplicon sequencing has become a well-established approach for microbial community profiling. Correlating shifts in the relative abundances of bacterial taxa with environmental gradients is the goal of many microbiome surveys. As the abundances generated by this technology are semi-quantitative by definition, the observed dynamics may not accurately reflect those of the actual taxon densities. We combined the sequencing approach (16S rRNA gene) with robust single-cell enumeration technologies (flow cytometry) to quantify the absolute taxon abundances. A detailed longitudinal analysis of the absolute abundances resulted in distinct abundance profiles that were less ambiguous and expressed in units that can be directly compared across studies. We further provide evidence that the enrichment of taxa (increase in relative abundance) does not necessarily relate to the outgrowth of taxa (increase in absolute abundance). Our results highlight that both relative and absolute abundances should be considered for a comprehensive biological interpretation of microbiome surveys.},

abstract = {To understand species abundance distributions effectively, it is essential to consider the forces which create the overwhelmingly long 'tail' of rare species. Both neutral and niche theory have been invoked to explain the rarity of certain species in ecological assemblages: niche theory stresses the importance of the resource division process, while neutral theory focuses on stochastic drift in densities of competitively identical species. Here, we show how migration and niche partitioning can act simultaneously to increase both the number of rare species and the total species richness. By simulating the dynamics of a metacommunity using an interconnected network of local communities, we incorporate niche partitioning into the otherwise per capita equivalent processes of birth and death. Niche partitioning is defined by the species niche fitness function, which is measured by the species optimal environmental conditions, the fundamental niche breadths of each species, and by the breadth of the environmental gradient of each local community. For a given niche breadth at the local community scale, unimodal relationships appear between the rate of migration, the number of rare species, and the total species richness. At the metacommunity scale, species richness was at first unaffected by increasing migration, but then crashed. At wide niche breadth, both the number of rare species and the total number of species started to decline at a low rate of migration. In contrast, when niche breadth was narrow, neither the number of rare species nor the total number of species started to decline until migration rates were much higher. This is because, for a given migration rate, niche breadth can affect the proportions of individuals coming from adjacent local communities. The integration of niche partitioning and migration therefore provides a rational explanation for the widespread rarity of species in ecological communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We discovered novel PAH-degrading bacteria (Oceanibaculum sp., Sneathiella sp.) and we identified other groups already known to possess this function (Alteromonas sp., Paracoccus sp.). Together with Cycloclasticus sp., these groups contributed to potential in situ phenanthrene degradation at a rate >0.5 mg l-1 day-1, sufficient to account for a considerable part of PAH degradation. Further, we characterized the PAH-tolerant bacterial communities, which were much more diverse in the polluted site by comparison to unpolluted marine references. PAH-tolerant bacteria were also members of the rare biosphere, such as Glaciecola sp. Collectively, these data show the complex interactions between PAH-degraders and PAH-tolerant bacteria and provide new insights for the understanding of the functional ecology of marine bacteria in polluted waters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While often obvious for macroscopic organisms, determining whether a microbe is dead or alive is fraught with complications. Fields such as microbial ecology, environmental health, and medical microbiology each determine how best to assess which members of the microbial community are alive, according to their respective scientific and/or regulatory needs. Many of these fields have gone from studying communities on a bulk level to the fine-scale resolution of microbial populations within consortia. For example, advances in nucleic acid sequencing technologies and downstream bioinformatic analyses have allowed for high-resolution insight into microbial community composition and metabolic potential, yet we know very little about whether such community DNA sequences represent viable microorganisms. In this review, we describe a number of techniques, from microscopy- to molecular-based, that have been used to test for viability (live/dead determination) and/or activity in various contexts, including newer techniques that are compatible with or complementary to downstream nucleic acid sequencing. We describe the compatibility of these viability assessments with high-throughput quantification techniques, including flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Although bacterial viability-linked community characterizations are now feasible in many environments and thus are the focus of this critical review, further methods development is needed for complex environmental samples and to more fully capture the diversity of microbes (e.g., eukaryotic microbes and viruses) and metabolic states (e.g., spores) of microbes in natural environments.},

abstract = {The conformational behavior and structural stability of chlorotoluene were investigated by utilizing ab initio calculations with 6-31G* basis set at restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and density function theory (DFT) levels. The vibrational frequencies of chlorotoluene were computed at the RHF and DFT levels. Complete vibrational assignments were made on the basis of normal coordinate calculations for stable conformer of the molecule. RHF results without scaled quantum mechanical (SQM) force field procedure considered are in bad agreement with experimental values. Of the five DFT methods, BLYP reproduces the observed fundamental frequencies most satisfactorily with the mean absolute deviation of the non-CH stretching modes less than 10 cm-1. Two hybrid DFT methods are found to yield frequencies, which are generally higher than the observed fundamental frequencies. When the calculated results are compared with 'experimental' frequencies, B3LYP method is found to be slightly more accurate for C-H stretching modes. The results indicate that BLYP calculation is a very promising approach for understanding the observed spectral features. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in molecular microbial ecology have yielded an unprecedented amount of data about the evolutionary relationships and functional traits of microbial communities that regulate global geochemical cycles. Biogeochemical models, however, are trailing in the wake of the environmental genomics revolution, and such models rarely incorporate explicit representations of bacteria and archaea, nor are they compatible with nucleic acid or protein sequence data. Here, we present a functional gene-based framework for describing microbial communities in biogeochemical models by incorporating genomics data to provide predictions that are readily testable. To demonstrate the approach in practice, nitrogen cycling in the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was modeled to examine key questions about cryptic sulfur cycling and dinitrogen production pathways in OMZs. Simulations support previous assertions that denitrification dominates over anammox in the central Arabian Sea, which has important implications for the loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans. Furthermore, cryptic sulfur cycling was shown to attenuate the secondary nitrite maximum often observed in OMZs owing to changes in the composition of the chemolithoautotrophic community and dominant metabolic pathways. Results underscore the need to explicitly integrate microbes into biogeochemical models rather than just the metabolisms they mediate. By directly linking geochemical dynamics to the genetic composition of microbial communities, the method provides a framework for achieving mechanistic insights into patterns and biogeochemical consequences of marine microbes. Such an approach is critical for informing our understanding of the key role microbes play in modulating Earth's biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts of species distribution and abundance require models that accommodate the range of ecological data, including a joint distribution of multiple species based on combinations of continuous and discrete observations, mostly zeros. We develop a generalized joint attribute model (GJAM), a probabilistic framework that readily applies to data that are combinations of presence-absence, ordinal, continuous, discrete, composition, zero-inflated, and censored. It does so as a joint distribution over all species providing inference on sensitivity to input variables, correlations between species on the data scale, prediction, sensitivity analysis, definition of community structure, and missing data imputation. GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species. Application to microbiome data demonstrates how inverse prediction in the GJAM framework accelerates variable selection, by isolating effects of each input variable's influence across all species.},

Many aspects of this complexity, from the number of species to the total number of interactions, are currently very difficult to examine directly. However, extraordinary efforts are being made to make these systems accessible to scientific investigation. While recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have improved accessibility to the taxonomic and functional diversity of complex communities, monitoring the dynamics of these systems over time and space - using appropriate experimental design - is still expensive. Fortunately, modeling can be used as a lens to focus low-resolution observations of community dynamics to enable mathematical abstractions of functional and taxonomic dynamics across space and time. Here, we review the approaches for modeling bacterial diversity at both the very large and the very small scales at which microbial systems interact with their environments. We show that modeling can help to connect biogeochemical processes to specific microbial metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {Bacterial communities are composed of distinct groups of potentially interacting lineages, each thought to occupy a distinct ecological niche. It remains unclear, however, how quickly niche preference evolves and whether more closely related lineages are more likely to share ecological niches. We addressed these questions by following the dynamics of two bloom-forming cyanobacteria genera over an 8-year time-course in Lake Champlain, Canada, using 16S amplicon sequencing and measurements of several environmental parameters. The two genera, Microcystis (M) and Dolichospermum (D), are frequently observed simultaneously during bloom events and thus have partially overlapping niches. However, the extent of their niche overlap is debated, and it is also unclear to what extent niche partitioning occurs among strains within each genus. To identify strains within each genus, we applied minimum entropy decomposition (MED). We confirmed that at a genus level, M and D have different preferences for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Within each genus, we also identified strains differentially associated with temperature, precipitation, and concentrations of nutrients and toxins. In general, niche similarity between strains (as measured by co-occurrence over time) declined with genetic distance. This pattern is consistent with habitat filtering -- in which closely-related taxa are ecologically similar, and therefore tend to co-occur under similar environmental conditions. In contrast with this general pattern, similarity in certain niche dimensions (notably particulate nitrogen and phosphorus) did not decline linearly with genetic distance, and instead showed a complex polynomial relationship. This observation suggests the importance of processes other than habitat filtering -- such as competition between closely-related taxa, or convergent trait evolution in distantly-related taxa -- in shaping particular traits in microbial communities.},

Most of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were allocated to rare taxa (89.6%), but the rare taxa comprised a small portion of the community in terms of abundance of sequences analyzed (28.6%). Temporal variations in OTUs richness significantly differed between the two taxa groups in which the rare taxa showed a higher diversity and a more fluctuating pattern than the general taxa. Furthermore, the two taxa groups were constrained by different explanatory variables: influent BOD, effluent BOD, and DO were the significant (P < 0.05) parameters affecting the pattern of the general taxa, while temperature was the factor for the rare taxa. Over the test period, the general taxa persisted for a longer time (i.e., lower turnover rate) in the bioreactor than the rare taxa. In conclusion, this study demonstrated clear differences in temporal dynamic patterns for the general and rare bacterial taxa in an activated sludge bioreactor, which would be a foundation for better understanding the bacterial ecology of activated sludge.},

abstract = {Deductions about the ecology of high taxonomic bacterial ranks (i.e., phylum, class, order) are often based on their abundance patterns, yet few studies have quantified how accurately variations in abundance of these bacterial groups represent the dynamics of the taxa within them. Using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we investigated whether the changes in abundance of six dominant bacterial classes (Actinobacteria, Beta-/Alpha-/Gamma-proteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and Sphingobacteria) along a large dam-regulated river are reflected by those of their constituent Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; 97% similarity level). The environmental impact generated by the reservoirs promoted clear compositional shifts in all bacterial classes that resulted from changes in the abundance of individual OTUs rather than from the appearance of new taxa along the river. Abundance patterns at the class level represented the dynamics of only a small but variable proportion of their constituting OTUs, which were not necessarily the most abundant ones. Within most classes, we detected sub-groups of OTUs showing contrasting responses to reservoir-induced environmental changes. Overall, we show that the patterns observed at the class level fail to capture the dynamics of a significant fraction of their constituent members, calling for caution when the ecological attributes of high-ranks are to be interpreted.},

The survey reveals a complex hydrologic regime with systematic variability in water balance due to local site characteristics. On average, runoff to lakes in wetland-dominated catchments is found to be significantly higher than runoff to upland-dominated lakes, with generally higher contributions from catchments with low bog/fen ratios. The isotope method, which relies primarily on water sampling and isotopic analysis, can be easily integrated in routine water quality surveys and is shown to be a practical alternative to conventional hydrological modelling for comparative analysis of water balance controls on hydrochemistry and aquatic ecology of lakes, particularly in low-relief wetland-rich terrain. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to test the effect of climate, permafrost and physio-geographical landscape parameters (bogs, forest and lake coverage of the watershed) on RSM and particulate C, N and P concentration in river water, we sampled 33 small and medium size rivers (10&ndash;100<span class="thinspace"></span>000<span class="thinspace"></span>km<sup>2</sup> watershed) along a 1700<span class="thinspace"></span>km N&ndash;S transect including both permafrost-affected and permafrost-free zones of Western Siberian Lowland (WSL). The concentration of C and N in RSM decreased with the increase in river watershed size, illustrating (i) the importance of organic debris in small rivers which drain peatlands and (ii) the role of mineral matter from bank abrasion in larger rivers. The presence of lakes in the watershed increased C and N but decreased P concentrations in RSM. The C<span class="thinspace"></span>:<span class="thinspace"></span>N ratio in the RSM reflected the source from deep rather than surface soil horizon, similar to that of other Arctic rivers. This suggests the export of peat and mineral particles through suprapermafrost flow occurring at the base of the active layer. There was a maximum of particulate C and N concentration at the beginning of permafrost appearance (a sporadic and discontinuous zone, 62&ndash;64°<span class="thinspace"></span>N). This presumably reflected the organic matter mobilization from newly thawed organic horizons in soils at the active latitudinal thawing front. The results suggest that a northward shift of permafrost boundaries and an increase in active layer thickness may increase particulate C and N export by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean by a factor of 2, while P export may remain unchanged. In contrast, within a long-term climate warming scenario, the disappearance of permafrost in the north, the drainage of lakes and transformation of bogs to forest may decrease C and N concentration in RSM by 2 to 3 times.</p></p>},

Anthropogenic activities, including wastewater discharge and river damming, raise adverse impacts on ecosystem and continuum of rivers. An increasing amount of attention has been paid to riverine bacterioplankton as they make vital contributions to biogeochemical nutrient cycle. A comprehensive study was conducted on the bacterioplankton community along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which is the longest plateau river in China and is suffering from various anthropogenic impacts. The results indicated that nutrient variations corresponded to anthropogenic activities, and silica, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by the dam. River damming influenced the biomass and diversity of the bacterioplankton, but significant alterations in the community structure were not observed between upstream and downstream of the dam. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the bacterioplankton community changed gradually along the river, and the dominant bacterioplankton in the upstream, midstream and downstream portions of the river were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively. Soluble reactive phosphorus, elevation, ammonium nitrogen, velocity and turbidity were the main environmental factors that shape the bacterioplankton community. Our study offers the first insights into the variation of a bacterioplankton community of a large river in plateau region.},

There are many problems as well as benefits of using the approach, but the former are often disregarded. Here the basis of the approach is summarised, including type of plate to use, treatment of samples, replication, incubation conditions, monitoring of plates, and statistical analysis.

Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known “mock communities” at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diver- sity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of meta- analysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/ nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demon- strate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recap- ture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of con- ducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simul- taneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

Dislocations multiply and annihilate by glide in {110} planes and cross-slip, as in pure Fe. Curved non-screw parts are highly mobile, though they are subjected to a frictional stress which has been estimated. Straight screw segments have a slow and steady motion at all temperatures, corresponding to a classical kink-pair mechanism. In particular, they do not exhibit the transition to jerky motion that has previously been observed in pure Fe at low temperatures, and which has been correlated with the hump in the stress–temperature curve. Under such conditions, the softening effect is interpreted as being due to the shift of the transition and corresponding hump to lower temperatures, as in FeC.},

abstract = {Organic matter (OM) is degraded during transport from soils to oceans. However, there are spatial and temporal variabilities along the aquatic continuum, which hamper the development of carbon cycling models. One concept that has been applied in this context is the priming effect (PE), describing non-additive effects on OM degradation after mixing sources of contrasting bioavailability. Studies on the aquatic PE report divergent results from positive (increased OM degradation rates) to neutral, to negative (decreased OM degradation rates) effects upon mixing. Here, we aim to condense the outcomes of these studies on aquatic PE. Based on a literature review, we discuss differences in the reported PEs across freshwater and marine ecosystems, identifying system-specific features that could favour non-additive effects on OM degradation. Using a quantitative meta-analysis approach, we evaluated the occurrence, direction (positive vs. negative) and magnitude of aquatic PE. The meta-analysis revealed a mean PE of 12.6%, which was not significantly different from zero across studies. Hence, mixing of contrasting OM sources in aquatic ecosystems does not necessarily result in a change in OM degradation rates. Therefore, we suggest to focus on molecular and microbial diversity and function, which could provide a better mechanistic understanding of processes driving OM interactions.},

In this study we use a modelling approach to investigate the effect of size on the probability of between-continent dispersal using virtual microorganisms in a global model of the Earths atmosphere. Location Global. Methods We use a computer model of global atmospheric circulation to investigate the effect of microbe size (effective diameters of 9, 20, 40 and 60 mu m) on the probability of aerial dispersal. Results We found that for smaller microbes, once airborne, dispersal is remarkably successful over a 1-year period. The most striking results are the extensive within-hemisphere distribution of virtual microbes of 9 and 20 mu m diameter and the lack of dispersal between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the year-long time-scale of our simulations. Main conclusions Above a diameter of 20 mu m wind dispersal of virtual microbes between continents becomes increasingly unlikely, and it does not occur at all (within our simulated 1-year period) for those of 60 mu m diameter. Within our simulation, the success of small microbes in long-distance dispersal is due both to their greater abundance and to their longer time in the atmosphere - once airborne - compared with larger microbes.},

abstract = {The character of organic carbon (OC) in lake waters is strongly dependent on the time water has spent in the landscape as well as in the lake itself due to continuous biogeochemical OC transformation processes. A common view is that upstream lakes might prolong the water retention in the landscape, resulting in an altered OC character downstream. We calculated the number of lakes upstream for 24,742 Swedish lakes in seven river basins spanning from 568 to 688 N. For each of these lakes, we used a lake volume to discharge comparison on a landscape scale to account for upstream water retention by lakes (Tn tot). We found a surprisingly weak relationship between the number of lakes upstream and Tn tot. Accordingly, we found that the coloured fraction of organic carbon was not related to lake landscape position but significantly related to Tn tot when we analysed lake water chemical data from 1,559 lakes in the studied river basins. Thus, we conclude that water renewal along the aquatic continuum by lateral water inputs offsets cumulative retention by lakes. Based on our findings, we suggest integrating Tntot in studies that address lake landscape position in the boreal zone to better understand variations in the character of organic carbon across lake districts.},

abstract = {Multiple forces structure natural microbial communities, but the relative roles and interactions of these drivers are poorly understood. Gradients of physical and chemical parameters can be especially influential. In traditional ecological theory, variability in environmental conditions across space and time represents habitat heterogeneity, which may shape communities. Here we used aquatic microbial communities as a model to investigate the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and community composition and dynamics. We defined spatial habitat heterogeneity as vertical temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients in the water column, and temporal habitat heterogeneity as variation throughout the open-water season in these environmental parameters. Seasonal lake mixing events contribute to temporal habitat heterogeneity by destroying and re-creating these gradients. Because of this, we selected three lakes along a range of annual mixing frequency (polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) for our study. We found that bacterial community composition (BCC) was distinct between the epilimnion and hypolimnion within stratified lakes, and also more variable within the epilimnia through time. We found stark differences in patterns of epilimnion and hypolimnion dynamics over time and across lakes, suggesting that specific drivers have distinct relative importance for each community.},

abstract = {Here, we used data of complete genomes to study comparatively the metabolism of different species. We built phenetic trees based on the enzymatic functions present in different parts of metabolism. Seven broad metabolic classes, comprising a total of 69 metabolic pathways, were comparatively analyzed for 27 fully sequenced organisms of the domains Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic profiles based on the presence/absence of enzymatic functions for each metabolic class were determined and distance matrices for all the organisms were then derived from the profiles. Unrooted phenetic trees based upon the matrices revealed the distribution of the organisms according to their metabolic capabilities, reflecting the ecological pressures and adaptations that those species underwent during their evolution. We found that organisms that are closely related in phylogenetic terms could be distantly related metabolically and that the opposite is also true. For example, obligate bacterial pathogens were usually grouped together in our metabolic trees, demonstrating that obligate pathogens share common metabolic features regardless of their diverse phylogenetic origins. The branching order of proteobacteria often did not match their classical phylogenetic classification and Gram-positive bacteria showed diverse metabolic affinities. Archaea were found to be metabolically as distant from free-living bacteria as from eukaryotes, and sometimes were placed close to the metabolically highly specialized group of obligate bacterial pathogens. Metabolic trees represent an integrative approach for the comparison of the evolution of the metabolism and its correlation with the evolution of the genome, helping to find new relationships in the tree of life. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Regional variations in evaporation losses and water budget are interpreted from systematic isotopic patterns in surface waters across a 275,000 km2 region of northern Canada. Differential heavy isotope enrichment in a set of >255 nonheadwater lakes sampled by floatplane during 1993 and 1994 is strongly correlated to varying hydroclimatic conditions across the region. Calculated catchment-weighted evaporation losses typically range from ∼ 10-15% in tundra areas draining into the Arctic Ocean to as high as 60% in forested subarctic areas draining to the Mackenzie River via Great Bear or Great Slave Lakes. Because of the diversity in drainage order and the ratio of catchment to surface area, lakes in the region may inherit as little as 30% to as much as 99% of their isotopic enrichment signal from upstream water bodies. Open-water evaporation generally decreases with increasing latitude and accounts for 5-50% of total evapotranspiration. Coupling of meteorological and isotopic data permits a novel assessment of regional evaporation-transpiration flux partitioning in the three major ecoclimatic zones (high-boreal forest, subarctic forest-tundra, and low-arctic shrub tundra), while the differing frequency distributions of lake water balance in these zones provides a new index of landscape-scale hydroclimatology that may have significant potential for investigating ongoing (or past) changes in response to high-latitude climate change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. Recent advances in microbiology techniques, such as genetic sequencing, allow for rapid and cost-effective collection of large quantities of genetic information carried within water samples. Here we posit that the unique composition of aquatic DNA material within a water sample contains relevant information about hydrologic function at multiple temporal scales. In this study, machine learning was used to develop discharge prediction models trained on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 16S rRNA gene sequences from six large arctic rivers. We term this approach "genohydrology," and show that OTU relative abundances can be used to predict river discharge at monthly and longer timescales. Based on a single DNA sample from each river, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for predicted mean monthly discharge values throughout the year was 0.84, while the NSE for predicted discharge values across different return intervals was 0.67. These are considerable improvements over predictions based only on the area-scaled mean specific discharge of five similar rivers, which had average NSE values of 0.64 and -0.32 for seasonal and recurrence interval discharge values, respectively. The genohydrology approach demonstrates that genetic diversity within the aquatic microbiome is a large and underutilized data resource with benefits for prediction of hydrologic function.},

In order to truly understand and predict environmental processes, however, the distinction between active, inactive and dead microbial cells is critical. Also, experimental designs need to be sensitive toward varying population complexity and activity, and temporal as well as spatial scales of process rates. There are a number of approaches, including single-cell techniques, which were designed to study in situ microbial activity and that have been successively coupled to nucleic acid sequencing. The exciting new discoveries regarding in situ microbial activity provide evidence that future microbial ecology studies will indispensably rely on techniques that specifically capture members of the microbiome active in the environment. Herein, we review those currently used activity-based approaches that can be directly linked to shotgun nucleic acid sequencing, evaluate their relevance to ecology studies, and discuss future directions.},

Although this objective seems straight forward, there are conceptual and methodological challenges to designing studies that explicitly evaluate this link. Here, we analyzed literature documenting structure and process responses to manipulations to determine the frequency of structure-process links and whether experimental approaches and techniques influence link detection. We examined nine journals (published 2009-13) and retained 148 experimental studies measuring microbial community structure and processes. Many qualifying papers (112 of 148) documented structure and process responses, but few (38 of 112 papers) reported statistically testing for a link. Of these tested links, 75% were significant and typically used Spearman or Pearson's correlation analysis (68%). No particular approach for characterizing structure or processes was more likely to produce significant links. Process responses were detected earlier on average than responses in structure or both structure and process. Together, our findings suggest that few publications report statistically testing structure-process links. However, when links are tested for they often occur but share few commonalities in the processes or structures that were linked and the techniques used for measuring them.},

We clustered the samples based on similarities in the phylogenetic lineages that they contain and found that, surprisingly, the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition is salinity rather than extremes of temperature, pH, or other physical and chemical factors represented in our samples. We find that sediments are more phylogenetically diverse than any other environment type. Surprisingly, soil, which has high species-level diversity, has below-average phylogenetic diversity. This work provides a framework for understanding the impact of environmental factors on bacterial evolution and for the direction of future sequencing efforts to discover new lineages.},

abstract = {Batch cultures of aquatic bacteria and dissolved organic matter were used to examine the impact of carbon source concentration on bacterial growth, biomass, growth efficiency, and community composition. An aged concentrate of dissolved organic matter from a humic lake was diluted with organic compound-free artificial lake water to obtain concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranging from 0.04 to 2.53 mM. The bacterial biomass produced in the cultures increased linearly with the DOC concentration, indicating that bacterial biomass production was limited by the supply of carbon. The bacterial growth rate in the exponential growth phase exhibited a hyperbolic response to the DOC concentration, suggesting that the maximum growth rate was constrained by the substrate concentration at low DOC concentrations. Likewise, the bacterial growth efficiency calculated from the production of biomass and CO2 increased asymptotically from 0.4 to 10.4% with increasing DOC concentration. The compositions of the microbial communities that emerged in the cultures were assessed by separation of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the gel profiles showed that there was a gradual change in the community composition along the DOC gradient; members of the ? subclass of the class Proteobacteria and members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group were well represented at all concentrations, whereas members of the ? subclass of the Proteobacteria were found exclusively at the lowest carbon concentration. The shift in community composition along the DOC gradient was similar to the patterns of growth efficiency and growth rate. The results suggest that the bacterial growth efficiencies, the rates of bacterial growth, and the compo- sitions of bacterial communities are not constrained by substrate concentrations in most natural waters, with the possible exception of the most oligotrophic environments.},

abstract = {Akinetes are dormancy cells commonly found among filamentous cyanobacteria, many of which are toxic and/or nuisance, bloom-forming species. Development of akinetes from vegetative cells is a process that involves morphological and biochemical modifications. Here, we applied a single-cell approach to quantify genome and ribosome content of akinetes and vegetative cells in Aphanizomenon ovalisporum (Cyanobacteria). Vegetative cells of A. ovalisporum were naturally polyploid and contained, on average, eight genome copies per cell. However, the chromosomal content of akinetes increased up to 450 copies, with an average value of 119 genome copies per akinete, 15-fold higher than that in vegetative cells. On the basis of fluorescence in situ hybridization, with a probe targeting 16S rRNA, and detection with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we conclude that ribosomes accumulated in akinetes to a higher level than that found in vegetative cells. We further present evidence that this massive accumulation of nucleic acids in akinetes is likely supported by phosphate supplied from inorganic polyphosphate bodies that were abundantly present in vegetative cells, but notably absent from akinetes. These results are interpreted in the context of cellular investments for proliferation following a long-term dormancy, as the high nucleic acid content would provide the basis for extended survival, rapid resumption of metabolic activity and cell division upon germination.},

We used water $\delta$2H and $\delta$18O from ca. 1000 lakes sampled in the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA) to assess two hydrological variables—evaporation as a percentage of inflow (E:I) and water residence time (t) for summer 2007. Using a population survey design, sampled lakes were distributed across the conterminous U.S., and results were scaled to the inference population (̴50,000 U.S. lakes). These hydrologic variables were related to lake nutrients and biological condition to illustrate their usefulness in national water quality monitoring efforts. For 50% of lakes, evaporation was, 25% of inflow, with values ranging up to 113% during the 2007 summer. Residence time was, 0.52 yr for half of the lakes and, 1.12 yr for 75% of lakes. Categorizing lakes by flow regime, 66.1% of lakes were flow-though lakes (60% or more of the water flows through the lake, E:I, 0.4), 33.6% were restricted-basin lakes (40% or more of the lake inflow evaporates, 0.4, E:I, 1), and, 0.3% were closed basin (all water entering the lake leaves through evaporation, E:I. 1). While climate patterns drove some of the spatial patterns of E:I and $\tau$, variation in lake depth and watershed size (influencing precipitation volume) were also significant drivers. Lake hydrochemistry was strongly correlated to E:I and more weakly related to $\tau$. Lakes in poor biological condition (based on a predictive model of planktonic taxa) were significantly more evaporated than lakes in good biological condition.},

abstract = {Temporal dynamics of bacterioplankton are rarely investigated for multiple habitats and years within individual lakes, limiting our understanding of the variability of bacterioplankton community (BC) composition with respect to environmental factors. We assessed the BC composition of a littoral and two pelagic habitats (euphotic zone and hypolimnion) of Lake Tovel monthly from April 2014 to May 2017 by high-throughput sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The three habitats differed in temperature, light, oxygen and hydrology. In particular, the littoral was the most hydrologically unstable because it receives most of the lake inflow, the hypolimnion was the most stable because of its hydrologically sheltered position, and the pelagic euphotic habitat was intermediate. Consequently, we hypothesized different temporal patterns of BC composition for all three habitats according to their environmental differences. We applied PERMANOVA, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and source–sink analysis to characterize BC composition. Overall, BCs were different among habitats with the littoral showing the highest variability and the hypolimnion the highest stability. The BC of rainy 2014 was distinct from the BCs of other years irrespective of the habitats considered. Seasonal differences in BCs were limited to spring, probably linked to meltwater inflow and mixing. Thus, temporal effects related to year and season were linked to the hydrological gradient of habitats. We suggest that despite potential within-lake dispersal of bacterioplankton by water flow and mixing, local environmental conditions played a major role in Lake Tovel, fostering distinct BCs in the three habitats.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are at the heart of all ecosystems, and yet microbial community behavior in disturbed environments remains difficult to measure and predict. Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability, including resistance (insensitivity to disturbance) and resilience (the rate of recovery after disturbance) is important for predicting community response to disturbance. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we next examine representative studies from the literature that investigated community responses to press (long-term) and pulse (short-term) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts about the unique insights that systems perspectives - informed by meta-omics data - may provide about microbial community stability.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton respiration (BR) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from freshwaters. Complete understanding of BR is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient (RQ; mole of CO(2) produced per mole of O(2) consumed) to calculate rates of BR. Many studies have, without clear support, assumed a fixed RQ around 1. Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada), using O(2) and CO(2) optic sensors. The RQs tended to converge around 1.2, but showed large variability (s.d.=0.45) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level, substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics. Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds. RQs were on average low in net autotrophic systems, where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates, whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates, for example, organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes, led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems. Further, we suggest that BR contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO(2) emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ∼1. Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of BR determination, but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Disturbances influence community structure and ecosystem functioning. Bacteria are key players in ecosystems and it is therefore crucial to understand the effect of disturbances on bacterial communities and how they respond to them, both compositionally and functionally. The main aim of this study was to test the effect of differences in disturbance strength on bacterial communities. For this, we implemented two independent short-term experiments with dialysis bags containing natural bacterial communities, which were transplanted between ambient and 'disturbed' incubation tanks, manipulating either the intensity or the frequency of a salinity disturbance. We followed changes in community composition by terminal restriction fragment analysis (T-RFLP) and measured various community functions (bacterial production, carbon substrate utilization profiles and rates) directly after and after a short period of recovery under ambient conditions. Increases in disturbance strength resulted in gradually stronger changes in bacterial community composition and functions. In the disturbance intensity experiment, the sensitivity to the disturbance and the ability of recovery differed between different functions. In the disturbance frequency experiment, effects on the different functions were more consistent and recovery was not observed. Moreover, in case of the intensity experiment, there was also a time lag in the responses of community composition and functions, with functional responses being faster than compositional ones. To summarize, our study shows that disturbance strength has the potential to change the functional performance and composition of bacterial communities. It further highlights that the overall effects, rates of recovery and the degree of congruence in the response patterns of community composition and functioning along disturbance gradients depend on the type of function and the character of the disturbance.},

abstract = {The influence of spatial processes on diversity and community dynamics is generally recognized in ecology and also applied to conservation projects involving forest and grassland ecosystems. Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

However, it is currently unclear to what extent the importance of the different mechanisms depends on community traits. Here, we implemented a study using a rock pool metacommunity to test whether habitat specialization of bacterial taxa and groups or their phylogenetic identity influenced by which mechanisms communities were assembled. In general, our results show that species sorting was the most important assembly mechanism. However, we found that a larger fraction of the variation in bacterial community composition between pools could be explained by environmental factors in case of habitat generalists, that is, taxa that were widespread and abundant in the metacommunity, compared with habitat specialists, that is, taxa that had a more restricted distribution range and tended to be rare. Differences in assembly mechanisms were observed between different major phyla and classes. However, also here, a larger fraction of the variation in community composition among pools could be explained for taxonomic groups that contained on average more habitat generalists. In summary, our results show that species sorting is stronger for the most common taxa, indicating that beta-diversity along environmental gradients can be adequately described without considering rare taxa.},

The results showed an 10 overall high level of shared taxa among bacterial communities within each valley, how-ever the bacterial co-occurrence patterns were non-random, with evidence of habitat preferences. There were taxonomic differences in bacterial assemblages among the different valleys that were statistically related to dissolved organic carbon concentra-tion, conductivity and phytoplankton biomass.

We describe the effects of the three large reservoirs of the Ebro River (NE Iberian Peninsula) on bacterioplankton assemblages by comparing several sites located before and after the impoundments on three occasions. We monitored the abundances of several bacterial phylotypes identified by rRNA gene probing, and those of two functional groups (picocyanobacteria and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria-AAPs). Much greater numbers of particles colonized by bacteria were found in upstream waters than downstream sites. Picocyanobacteria were found in negligible numbers at most sites, whereas AAPs constituted up to 14% of total prokaryotes, but there was no clear effect of reservoirs on the spatial dynamics of these two groups. Instead, damming caused a pronounced decline in Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes from upstream to downstream sites, whereas Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria significantly increased after the reservoirs. Redundancy analysis revealed that conductivity, temperature and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were the environmental predictors that best explained the observed variability in bacterial community composition. Our data show that impoundments exerted significant impacts on bacterial riverine assemblages and call attention to the unforeseen ecological consequences of river regulation.},

abstract = {Methane emission from peatlands contributes substantially to global warming but is significantly reduced by sulfate reduction, which is fuelled by globally increasing aerial sulfur pollution. However, the biology behind sulfate reduction in terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood and the key players for this process as well as their abundance remained unidentified. Comparative 16S rRNA gene stable isotope probing (SIP) in the presence and absence of sulfate indicated that a Desulfosporosinus species, which constitutes only 0.006% of the total microbial community 16S rRNA genes, is an important sulfate reducer in a long-term experimental peatland field site. Parallel SIP using dsrAB (encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase) identified no additional sulfate reducers under the conditions tested. For the identified Desulfosporosinus species a high cell-specific sulfate reduction rate of up to 341 fmol SO₄²⁻ cell⁻¹ day⁻¹ was estimated. Thus, the small Desulfosporosinus population has the potential to reduce sulfate in situ at a rate of 4.0-36.8 nmol (g soil w. wt.)⁻¹ day⁻¹, sufficient to account for a considerable part of sulfate reduction in the peat soil. Modeling of sulfate diffusion to such highly active cells identified no limitation in sulfate supply even at bulk concentrations as low as 10 $\mu$M. Collectively, these data show that the identified Desulfosporosinus species, despite being a member of the 'rare biosphere', contributes to an important biogeochemical process that diverts the carbon flow in peatlands from methane to CO₂ and, thus, alters their contribution to global warming.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

abstract = {Abstract Northern ecosystems are experiencing some of the most dramatic impacts of global change on Earth. Rising temperatures, hydrological intensification, changes in atmo- spheric acid deposition and associated acidification recovery, and changes in vegeta- tive cover are resulting in fundamental changes in terrestrial–aquatic biogeochemical linkages. The effects of global change are readily observed in alterations in the sup- ply of dissolved organic matter (DOM)—the messenger between terrestrial and lake ecosystems—with potentially profound effects on the structure and function of lakes. Northern terrestrial ecosystems contain substantial stores of organic matter and filter or funnel DOM, affecting the timing and magnitude of DOM delivery to surface waters. This terrestrial DOM is processed in streams, rivers, and lakes, ulti- mately shifting its composition, stoichiometry, and bioavailability. Here, we explore the potential consequences of these global change-driven effects for lake food webs at northern latitudes. Notably, we provide evidence that increased allochthonous DOM supply to lakes is overwhelming increased autochthonous DOM supply that potentially results from earlier ice-out and a longer growing season. Furthermore, we assess the potential implications of this shift for the nutritional quality of auto- trophs in terms of their stoichiometry, fatty acid composition, toxin production, and methylmercury concentration, and therefore, contaminant transfer through the food web. We conclude that global change in northern regions leads not only to reduced primary productivity but also to nutritionally poorer lake food webs, with discernible consequences for the trophic web to fish and humans.},

abstract = {The accurate description of a microbial community is an important first step in understanding the roles of its components in ecosystem function. A method for surveying microbial communities termed serial analysis of rRNA genes (SARD) is described here. Through a series of molecular cloning steps, short DNA sequence tags are recovered from the fifth variable (V5) region of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes from microbial communities. These tags are ligated to form concatemers comprised of 20 to 40 tags which are cloned and identified by DNA sequencing. Four agricultural soil samples were profiled with SARD to assess the method's utility. A total of 37,008 SARD tags comprising 3,127 unique sequences were identified. A comparison of duplicate profiles from one soil genomic DNA preparation revealed that the method was highly reproducible. The large numbers of singleton tags, together with nonparametric richness estimates, indicated that a significant amount of sequence tag diversity remained undetected with this level of sampling. The abundance classes of the observed tags were scale-free and conformed to a power law distribution. Numerically, the majority of the total tags observed belonged to abundance classes that were each present at less than 1% of the community. Over 99% of the unique tags individually made up less than 1% of the community. Therefore, from either a numerical or diversity standpoint, taxa with low abundance comprised a significant proportion of the microbial communities examined and could potentially make a large contribution to ecosystem function. SARD may provide a means to explore the ecological roles of these rare members of microbial communities in qualitative and quantitative terms.},

abstract = {Arctic river watersheds are important components of the global climate system and show an amplified response to climate change. Here, we characterize origins and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Yenisei, Ob, Mackenzie) over 3 years with seasonal sampling periods using measurements of carbohydrates, amino acids, bacterial biomarkers (D-amino acids), and plant protein biomarkers (hydroxyproline). A strong seasonal cycle of bioavailable DOM export was observed that correlated with discharge, vegetation, river morphology and water residence time. The chemical composition of bioavailable DOM was different among rivers reflecting unique characteristics of Arctic river watersheds. Trends in specific bacterial biomarkers were synchronous to changes in bacterial community compositions demonstrating that bacterial communities responded to the seasonal shifts in organic matter quality and chemical composition. Extensive heterotrophic processing of plant and soil-derived DOM resulted in major inputs of bacterial detritus, and bacterial organic matter accounted for 21–42% of DOC in all watersheds. Dissolved organic nitrogen sources were dominated by bacterially-derived nitrogen and important contributions of soluble plant protein during the Spring freshet. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of watershed characteristics and bacterial metabolism in regulating DOM composition, reactivity and carbon fluxes in Arctic river watersheds.},

abstract = {Climate feedbacks from soils can result from environmental change followed by response of plant and microbial communities, and/or associated changes in nutrient cycling. Explicit consideration of microbial life-history traits and functions may be necessary to predict climate feedbacks owing to changes in the physiology and community composition of microbes and their associated effect on carbon cycling. Here we developed the microbial enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model by incorporating microbial dormancy and the ability to track multiple isotopes of carbon. We tested two versions of MEND, that is, MEND with dormancy (MEND) and MEND without dormancy (MEND_wod), against long-term (270 days) carbon decomposition data from laboratory incubations of four soils with isotopically labeled substrates. MEND_wod adequately fitted multiple observations (total C-CO2 and (14)C-CO2 respiration, and dissolved organic carbon), but at the cost of significantly underestimating the total microbial biomass. MEND improved estimates of microbial biomass by 20-71% over MEND_wod. We also quantified uncertainties in parameters and model simulations using the Critical Objective Function Index method, which is based on a global stochastic optimization algorithm, as well as model complexity and observational data availability. Together our model extrapolations of the incubation study show that long-term soil incubations with experimental data for multiple carbon pools are conducive to estimate both decomposition and microbial parameters. These efforts should provide essential support to future field- and global-scale simulations, and enable more confident predictions of feedbacks between environmental change and carbon cycling.},

Surprisingly, efforts to measure immigration in bacterial communities are rare. An 8-week time series of within-lake bacterial community composition and atmospheric deposition rates and composition were used to estimate the influence of immigration on bacterial community dynamics in two north temperate lakes. Characterization of bacterial community dynamics using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis suggested moderate overlap in composition between the lakes and atmospherically deposited cells. However, taxa that appeared to be delivered by atmospheric deposition had a relatively minor influence on lake bacterial community dynamics. The weak influence of immigrating bacterial taxa suggests that a species-sorting concept best describes aquatic bacterial metacommunity dynamics.},

@article{Lavorel2002c,
abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal distributions of rare microbial taxa were examined in 384 samples from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, in the northwestern Sargasso Sea. Sequences were partitioned into 6 mutually exclusive sets based on abundance (abundant, rare, and very rare) and frequency of detection (frequent and infrequent). Analyses of variance for taxa that were frequently present, across all levels of abundance, demonstrated environmental filtering, indicating that gradients in environmental factors, such as season and depth, drive community assembly for rare taxa, as they do for abundant taxa. All abundant nodal taxonomic units (NTUs) had spatiotemporal periods of rarity, providing a clear demonstration of the role of fluctuating reproductive success in population dynamics, and the role of rare populations as seed banks. An inverse relationship between the number of rare taxa and physical stratification indicates that transport by mixing drives increased community diversity throughout most of the year. Populations of selected copiotrophic taxa varied in episodic patterns that were not tightly entrained to season and depth, indicating that these populations are not governed by the same rules of community assembly that apply to most other taxa and may be adapted to exploit infrequent, unknown disturbances. Overall, the findings support the perspective that the success of most rare populations was driven by the same fundamental patterns of spatiotemporal variation that drove the success of dominant populations, but also indicate potentially important roles for transport by mixing and atypical life histories in determination of community composition.},

Cells were allowed to light-shade adapt on some time scale by altering chl:carbon ratios in response to variations in light regimes. Photosynthetic response was adjusted according to variations in chl: carbon ratios by either varying the initial slopes of photosynthesis-irradiance curves, or varying photosynthetic capacities. The model suggests that despite physiological adaptation to light, vertical mixing may have little effect on the integrated water column primary productivity. It is suggested that if photoinhibition does not have a pronounced effect, the average distribution of primary production in a water column is not related to variations in light regimes arising from turbulent diffusion processes.},

Here, we test the efficacy of a trait-based model in predicting gross primary production (GPP) in lake ecosystems. We incorporated data from .1000 United States lakes along with laboratory-generated phytoplankton trait data to build a trait- based model of GPP and then validated the model with GPP observations from a separate set of globally distributed lakes. The trait-based model performed as well as or outperformed two ecosystem models both spatially and temporally, demonstrating the efficacy of trait-based models for predicting ecosystem function over a range of environmental conditions.},

These results suggest a predictive framework whereby the genetic (or taxonomic) resolution of microbiome variation among samples provides information about the traits under selection. The organizational parallels seen among human and free-living microbiomes seem to support this idea. Developments in this framework may offer predictions not only for how microbial composition responds to changing environmental conditions, but also for how these changes may alter the health or functioning in human, engineered, and environmental systems.},

We hypothesized that keystone taxa, which influence community assembly through strong biotic interactions, are important for regulating microbial community composition. While highly connected microbes have been identified, evidence that these taxa act as keystones is lacking, because keystone status requires influence on whole-community dynamics. We address this gap, showing that small subsets of highly connected keystone taxa (generally 1‐5% of richness) can be optimal predictors of whole-community compositional change. In three long-term datasets, greater connectivity due to the presence of keystone taxa corresponded to lower compositional turnover. We further hypothesized that the influence of keystone taxa would be diminished when environmental disturbance was a strong driver of compositional change. We used two case studies of reference and disturbed communities to investigate how biotic and abiotic forces interact to shape community composition. Most of the same taxa were present in both the reference and disturbed communities, but keystone taxa had much greater explanatory power in the reference communities. Our results suggest that greater biotic connectivity arising from the presence of keystone taxa is stabilizing to community composition, and that keystone taxa can be good indicators of pending community shifts.},

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs-including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction-and of de novo OTUs-including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

abstract = {Natural ecosystems show variable resistance to invasion by alien species, and this resistance can relate to the species diversity in the system. In soil, microorganisms are key components that determine life support functions, but the functional redundancy in the microbiota of most soils has long been thought to overwhelm microbial diversity-function relationships. We here show an inverse relationship between soil microbial diversity and survival of the invading species Escherichia coli O157:H7, assessed by using the marked derivative strain T. The invader's fate in soil was determined in the presence of (i) differentially constructed culturable bacterial communities, and (ii) microbial communities established using a dilution-to-extinction approach. Both approaches revealed a negative correlation between the diversity of the soil microbiota and survival of the invader. The relationship could be explained by a decrease in the competitive ability of the invader in species-rich vs. species-poor bacterial communities, reflected in the amount of resources used and the rate of their consumption. Soil microbial diversity is a key factor that controls the extent to which bacterial invaders can establish.},

Genome sequences are available for many bacteria from the human microbiome and the ocean (over 800 and 200, respectively), but only two freshwater genomes are currently available: the streamlined genomes of Polynucleobacter necessarius ssp. asymbioticus and the Actinobacterium AcI-B1. Here, we sequenced and analysed draft genomes of eight phylogentically diverse freshwater bacteria exhibiting a range of life- style characteristics. Comparative genomics of these bacteria reveals putative freshwater bacterial life-styles based on differences in predicted growth rate, capability to respond to environmental stimuli and diversity of useable carbon substrates. Our conceptual model based on these genomic characteristics provides a foundation on which further ecophysiological and genomic studies can be built. In addi- tion, these genomes greatly expand the diversity of existing genomic context for future studies on the ecology and genetics of freshwater bacteria.},

However, the relationships between diversity and emergent properties of a community, such as its stability, productivity, or invasibility, are much more nuanced. In the submitted manuscript, I argue that diversity without context provides limited insights into the mechanisms underpinning community patterns. I provide examples from traditional and microbial ecology to discuss common complications and assumptions about within-sample diversity that may prevent us from digging deeper into the more specific mechanisms underpinning community outcomes. I suggest that measurement of diversity should serve as a starting point for further inquiry of ecological mechanisms rather than an “answer” to community outcomes.},

This community is shaped by complex interacting forces, including microbial dispersal from surrounding environments and in-stream selection. However, how the processes structuring stream communities change over space and time remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize spatial and temporal trends in microbial community composition throughout a stream network spanning first through fifth order streams. We found that the microbial communities of headwater streams are compositionally diverse, with low representation of freshwater microbial taxa and high representation of soil and sediment-associated taxa. In three out of five seasonal samplings, a successional pattern was identified in which phylotype richness and compositional heterogeneity decreased while the proportion of known freshwater taxa increased with increasing cumulative upstream dendritic distance. However, in two samplings, streams instead exhibited uniformly high microbial diversity across the watershed, and the fraction of freshwater taxa showed no relationship with dendritic distance. Overall, our data suggest that the successional processes that drive microbial diversity in streams are highly dynamic and can be disrupted at landscape scales, potentially in response to variation in temperature and precipitation.},

Blooms vary considerably in terms of eukaryotic species composition and environmental conditions, but a limited number of heterotrophic bacterial lineages-primarily members of the Flavobacteriia, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria-dominate these communities. In this Review, we discuss the central role that these bacteria have in transforming phytoplankton-derived organic matter and thus in biogeochemical nutrient cycling. On the basis of selected field and laboratory-based studies of flavobacteria and roseobacters, distinct metabolic strategies are emerging for these archetypal phytoplankton-associated taxa, which provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that dictate their behaviours during blooms.},

All systems were consistently supersaturated in CO2 (range 450 to 5000 matm) streams having both higher (mean 1850 matm) and more variable pCO2 than that of rivers (range 550 to 800 matm). Stream pCO2 was positively related to DOC concentration and stream segment length, both suggesting a direct influence of the surrounding landscape. Calculated stream water-air CO2 fluxes ranged from 700 to over 3000 mg C m-2 d-1, up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in large rivers and lakes of the same region. Small streams, despite their extremely reduced areal coverage (1% of the aquatic surface), accounted for 25% of the total aquatic C emissions, and the resulting areal stream fluxes were comparable to those measured in different soils or wetlands in the region.},

abstract = {Extremely low abundance microorganisms (members of the "rare biosphere") are believed to include dormant taxa, which can sporadically become abundant following environmental triggers. Yet, microbial transitions from rare to abundant have seldom been captured in situ, and it is uncertain how widespread these transitions are. A bloom of a single ribotype (≥99% similarity in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) of a widespread betaproteobacterium (Janthinobacterium sp.) occurred over 2 weeks in Arctic marine waters. The Janthinobacterium population was not detected microscopically in situ in January and early February, but suddenly appeared in the water column thereafter, eventually accounting for up to 20% of bacterial cells in mid February. During the bloom, this bacterium was detected at open water sites up to 50 km apart, being abundant down to more than 300 m. This event is one of the largest monospecific bacterial blooms reported in polar oceans. It is also remarkable because Betaproteobacteria are typically found only in low abundance in marine environments. In particular, Janthinobacterium were known from non-marine habitats and had previously been detected only in the rare biosphere of seawater samples, including the polar oceans. The Arctic Janthinobacterium formed mucilagenous monolayer aggregates after short (ca. 8 h) incubations, suggesting that biofilm formation may play a role in maintaining rare bacteria in pelagic marine environments. The spontaneous mass occurrence of this opportunistic rare taxon in polar waters during the energy-limited season extends current knowledge of how and when microbial transitions between rare and abundant occur in the ocean.},

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S rRNA sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and DNA abundances. In total, 7,081 16S rRNA sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1-15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S rRNA copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S rRNA copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S rRNA gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S rRNA genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S rRNA copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S rRNA copy numbers among bacteria is considered.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that these rare taxa serve as limitless reservoirs of genetic diversity, and perform disproportionate types of functions despite their low abundances. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling rarity and the processes promoting the development of the rare biosphere. Here, we propose the use of multivariate cut-offs to estimate rare species and phylogenetic null models applied to predefined rare taxa to disentangle the relative influences of ecoevolutionary processes mediating the assembly of the rare biosphere. Importantly, the identification of the factors controlling rare species assemblages is critical for understanding the types of rarity, how the rare biosphere is established, and how rare microorganisms fluctuate over spatiotemporal scales, thus enabling prospective predictions of ecosystem responses.},

Patterns generated with each parameter were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) to test relative resolving power. Samples of equivalent cell density (undiluted samples) were correctly classified by rhizosphere type for all parameters based on DFA analysis of the first five PC scores. Analysis of undiluted and 1:4 diluted samples resulted in misclassification of at least two of the wheat samples for all parameters except the AWCD normalized (0.50 abs. units) data, and analysis of undiluted, 1:4, and 1:16 diluted samples resulted in misclassification for all parameter types. Ordination of samples along the first principal component (PC) was correlated to inoculum density in analyses performed on all of the kinetic parameters, but no such influence was seen for AWCD-derived results. The carbon sources responsible for classification differed among the variable types with the exception of AREA and A, which were strongly correlated. These results indicate that the use of kinetic parameters for pattern analysis in CLPP may provide some additional information, but only if the influence of inoculum density is carefully considered. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France. Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved car- bon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations. These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapo- lated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.},

abstract = {A trade-off between strategies maximizing growth and minimizing losses appears to be a fundamental property of evolving biological entities existing in environments with limited resources. In the special case of unicellular planktonic organisms, the theoretical framework describing the trade-offs between competition and defense specialists is known as the "killing the winner" hypothesis (KtW). KtW describes how the availability of resources and the actions of predators (e.g., heterotrophic flagellates) and parasites (e.g., viruses) determine the composition and biogeochemical impact of such organisms. We extend KtW conceptually by introducing size- or shape-selective grazing of protozoans on prokaryotes into an idealized food web composed of prokaryotes, lytic viruses infecting prokaryotes, and protozoans. This results in a hierarchy analogous to a Russian doll, where KtW principles are at work on a lower level due to selective viral infection and on an upper level due to size- or shape-selective grazing by protozoans. Additionally, we critically discuss predictions and limitations of KtW in light of the recent literature, with particular focus on typically neglected aspects of KtW. Many aspects of KtW have been corroborated by in situ and experimental studies of isolates and natural communities. However, a thorough test of KtW is still hampered by current methodological limitations. In particular, the quantification of nutrient uptake rates of the competing prokaryotic populations and virus population-specific adsorption and decay rates appears to be the most daunting challenge for the years to come.},

abstract = {Aim While paradigms of macroecology are challenged by the high rates of reproduction, dispersal and horizontal gene exchange of bacterial communities, environmental DNA sequencing makes community profiles accessible. We test fundamental hypotheses of macroecological theories, showing that both taxonomic and functional classifications have distinct biogeographical variation across distance and environments depending on trophic composition. Location Studies spanning the global oceans. Methods Taxonomic and functional profiles were obtained from metagenomes and were compared across oceanographic regions and tested for patterns of co-occurrence. The influences of sampling method (filter size), environmental variables and geographical distribution were compared with distance-based linear models to test predictors of taxonomic and functional composition. Macroecological drivers were compared with bacterial community structure to test four biogeographical hypotheses: (1) no biogeographical patterns, (2) community structure reflects environmental dissimilarity, (3) community structure reflects distance, (4) community structure reflects environment and distance. Results Bacterial families were clustered into four trophic groups – phototrophic, oligotrophic, eutrophic and copiotrophic – by changes in abundance across oceanographic regions and co-occurrence with core functions. Changes in community composition were best modelled by longitude for free-living communities and dissolved oxygen for mixed communities of free-living and particle-associated bacteria. Both microhabitat and community assignment had an impact on biogeographical patterns, with taxonomic compositions following our hypotheses 2 and 4 and functional gene compositions following hypotheses 3 and 4. Main conclusions We described four trophic groups adding to the current dichotomy of the classification of marine bacteria as oligotrophic or copiotrophic. Taxonomic composition of mixed communities reflected environmental differences but not geographical distance, whereas functional gene composition in free-living communities was independent of environmental dissimilarity and reflected geographical distance. Patterns of biogeography in bacterial communities differed depending on the description of taxa or function. Therefore, we developed a new paradigm for bacterial ecology which shows that some aspects of bacterial evolution depend on trophic complexity, history and current environmental conditions.},

abstract = {One of the major contemporary challenges in microbial ecology has been to discriminate the reactive core from the random, unreactive components of bacterial communities. In previous work we used the spatial abundance distributions of bacterioplankton across boreal lakes of Qu{\'{e}}bec to group taxa into four distinct categories that reflect either hydrology-mediated dispersal along the aquatic network or environmental selection mechanisms within lakes. Here we test whether this categorization derived from the spatial distribution of taxa is maintained over time, by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the OTUs within those spatially-derived categories along an annual cycle in the oligotrophic lake Croche (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada), and assessing the coherence in the patterns of abundance, occurrence and environmental range of these OTUs over space and time. We report that the temporal dynamics of most taxa within a single lake are largely coherent with those derived from their spatial distribution over large spatial scales, suggesting that these properties must be intrinsic of particular taxa. We also identified a set of rare taxa catalogued as having a random occupancy based on their spatial distribution, but which showed clear seasonality and abundance peaks along the year, yet these comprised a very small fraction of the total rare OTUs. We conclude that the presence of most rare bacterioplankton taxa in boreal lakes is random, since both their temporal and spatial dynamics suggest links to passive downstream transport and persistence in freshwater networks, rather than environmental selection.},

abstract = {Seasonal shifts in bacterioplankton community composition in Toolik Lake, a tundra lake on the North Slope of Alaska, were related to shifts in the source (terrestrial versus phytoplankton) and lability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). A shift in community composition, measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes, occurred at 4°C in near-surface waters beneath seasonal ice and snow cover in spring. This shift was associated with an annual peak in bacterial productivity ([14C]leucine incorporation) driven by the large influx of labile terrestrial DOM associated with snow meltwater. A second shift occurred after the flux of terrestrial DOM had ended in early summer as ice left the lake and as the phytoplankton community developed. Bacterioplankton communities were composed of persistent populations present throughout the year and transient populations that appeared and disappeared. Most of the transient populations could be divided into those that were advected into the lake with terrestrial DOM in spring and those that grew up from low concentrations during the development of the phytoplankton community in early summer. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single ribotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical ribotypes. Bacteria were identified as members of globally distributed freshwater phylogenetic clusters within the - and -Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides group, and the Actinobacteria.},

abstract = {Several viruses infecting marine cyanobacteria carry photosynthesis genes (e.g. psbA, hli) that are expressed, yield proteins (D1, HLIP) and help maintain the cell's photosynthesis apparatus during the latent period. This increases energy and speeds up virus production, allowing for a reduced latent period (a fitness benefit), but it also increases the DNA size, which slows down new virus production and reduces burst size (a fitness cost). How do these genes affect the net ecological fitness of the virus? Here, this question is explored using a combined systems biology and systems ecology ('systems bioecology') approach. A novel agent-based model simulates individual cyanobacteria cells and virus particles, each with their own genes, transcripts, proteins and other properties. The effect of D1 and HLIP proteins is explicitly considered using a mechanistic photosynthesis component. The model is calibrated to the available database for Prochlorococcus ecotype MED4 and podovirus P-SSP7. Laboratory- and field-scale in silico survival, competition and evolution (gene packaging error) experiments with wild type and genetically engineered viruses are performed to develop vertical survival and fitness profiles, and to determine the optimal gene content. The results suggest that photosynthesis genes are nonessential, increase fitness in a manner correlated with irradiance, and that the wild type has an optimal gene content.},

abstract = {Resources structure ecological communities and potentially link biodiversity to energy flow. It is commonly believed that functional traits (generalists versus specialists) involved in the exploitation of resources depend on resource availability and environmental fluctuations. The longitudinal nature of stream ecosystems provides changing resources to stream biota with yet unknown effects on microbial functional traits and community structure. We investigated the impact of autochthonous (algal extract) and allochthonous (spruce extract) resources, as they change along alpine streams from above to below the treeline, on microbial diversity, community composition and functions of benthic biofilms. Combining bromodeoxyuridine labelling and 454 pyrosequencing, we showed that diversity was lower upstream than downstream of the treeline and that community composition changed along the altitudinal gradient. We also found that, especially for allochthonous resources, specialisation by biofilm bacteria increased along that same gradient. Our results suggest that in streams below the treeline biofilm diversity, specialisation and functioning are associated with increasing niche differentiation as potentially modulated by divers allochthonous and autochthonous constituents contributing to resources. These findings expand our current understanding on biofilm structure and function in alpine streams.},

To deduce important ecological indicators such as environmental adaptation, molecular trait dispersal, diversity variation and primary production from the gene pool of an ecosystem, we integrated 25 ocean metagenomes with geographical, meteorological and geophysicochemical data. We find that climatic factors (temperature, sunlight) are the major determinants of the biomolecular repertoire of each sample and the main limiting factor on functional trait dispersal (absence of biogeographic provincialism). Molecular functional richness and diversity show a distinct latitudinal gradient peaking at 20° N and correlate with primary production. The latter can also be predicted from the molecular functional composition of an environmental sample. Together, our results show that the functional community composition derived from metagenomes is an important quantitative readout for molecular trait-based biogeography and ecology.},

abstract = {<p>Freshwater bacterioplankton communities are influenced by the transport of bacteria from the surrounding terrestrial environments. It has been shown that, although most of these dispersed bacteria gradually disappear along the hydrologic continuum, some can thrive in aquatic systems and become dominant, leading to a gradual succession of communities. Here we aimed at exploring the environmental factors driving the structure of such contrasting bacterial populations as well as their functional properties. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we characterized the taxonomic composition of bacterioplankton communities from 10 streams and rivers in Qu{\'{e}}bec spanning the whole hydrologic continuum (river Strahler order 0 to 7), which were sampled in two occasions. With the aim to understand the fate and controls of the transported bacteria, among the taxa present at the origin of the hydrologic gradient (i.e., in the smallest headwater streams) we identified two types of dynamics: i) ‘Tourist' taxa, which were those that decreased in abundance from the headwaters towards the largest rivers, and ii) ‘Seed' taxa, those that increased their abundances along the hydrologic continuum. Communities changed gradually from the fast-flowing headwater streams dominated by ‘Tourist' taxa (ca. 95% of the sequences) towards the largest rivers (Strahler order 4-7) where ‘Seed' taxa comprised up to 80% of community sequences. Variation in taxonomic composition of the communities dominated by ‘Tourist' taxa in streams seemed related to different degree of terrestrial inputs, whereas compositional changes in ‘Seed' communities in the large rivers were linked to differences in autochthonous processes. Finally, the two types of communities differed significantly in their metabolic potential assessed through Biolog Ecoplates. All this suggests that hydrologic transport modulates the gradual replacement of two contrasting population types subjected to different environmental controls and with different metabolic potentials. Moreover, we show that the separate exploration of the two pools of taxa allows unveiling environmental drivers and processes operating on them that remain hidden if explored at the whole community level.</p>},

However, the roles that abiotic and biotic factors such as light and DOC release by aquatic primary producers play in the microbial decomposition of allochthonous DOC is not well understood. We therefore tested if light and autochthonous DOC additions would increase allochthonous DOC decomposition rates and change bacterial growth efficiencies and community composition (BCC). We established continuous growth cultures with different inocula of natural bacterial communities and alder leaf leachates (DOCleaf) with and without light exposure before amendment. Furthermore, we incubated DOCleaf together with autochthonous DOC from lysed phytoplankton cultures (DOCphyto). Our results revealed that pretreatments of DOCleaf with light resulted in a doubling of bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), whereas additions of DOCphyto or combined additions of DOCphyto and light had no effect on BGE. The change in BGE was not accompanied by shifts in the phylogenetic structure of the BCC, but BCC was influenced by the DOC source. Our results highlight that a doubling of BGE is not necessarily accompanied by a shift in BCC and that BCC is more strongly affected by resource properties.},

abstract = {The surface layer of the oceans and other aquatic environments contains many bacteria that range in activity, from dormant cells to those with high rates of metabolism. However, little experimental evidence exists about the activity of specific bacterial taxa, especially rare ones. Here we explore the relationship between abundance and activity by documenting changes in abundance over time and by examining the ratio of 16S rRNA to rRNA genes (rDNA) of individual bacterial taxa. The V1-V2 region of 16S rRNA and rDNA was analyzed by tag pyrosequencing in a 3-y study of surface waters off the Delaware coast. Over half of the bacterial taxa actively cycled between abundant and rare, whereas about 12% always remained rare and potentially inactive. There was a significant correlation between the relative abundance of 16S rRNA and the relative abundance of 16S rDNA for most individual taxa. However, 16S rRNA:rDNA ratios were significantly higher in about 20% of the taxa when they were rare than when abundant. Relationships between 16S rRNA and rDNA frequencies were confirmed for five taxa by quantitative PCR. Our findings suggest that though abundance follows activity in the majority of the taxa, a significant portion of the rare community is active, with growth rates that decrease as abundance increases.},

abstract = {The response of local communities to marine-freshwater transitions and the processes that underlie community assembly are unclear, particularly with respect to bacteria that differ in their life strategies. Here, we implemented a transplant experiment where bacterioplankton from three regions of the Baltic Sea with differing salinities (∼3, 7, and 28 psu) were exposed to each other's environmental conditions. We found that habitat specialists were more abundant than generalists after exposure to salinity changes, irrespective of their origins. Most specialists that were selected following a salinity change were rare in the starting communities. Selection for generalists, however, was not specifically driven by the recruitment of either rare or abundant members, suggesting that taxon's initial abundance is minor relevant for the growth of generalists. Patterns in phylogenetic relatedness indicated that environmental filtering was the most influential assembly mechanism for specialists, whereas competitive interaction was more important for the assembly of generalists. Altogether, this study shows that large salinity changes promote the establishment of habitat specialists and that deterministic processes vary during community assembly for ecologically dissimilar taxa. We therefore propose that distinguishing assembly mechanisms of different community members helps understand and predict community dynamics in response to environmental change.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing techniques are becoming attractive to molecular biologists and ecologists as they provide a time- and cost-effective way to explore diversity patterns in environmental samples at an unprecedented resolution. An issue common to many studies is the definition of what fractions of a data set should be considered as rare or dominant. Yet this question has neither been satisfactorily addressed, nor is the impact of such definition on data set structure and interpretation been fully evaluated. Here we propose a strategy, MultiCoLA (Multivariate Cutoff Level Analysis), to systematically assess the impact of various abundance or rarity cutoff levels on the resulting data set structure and on the consistency of the further ecological interpretation. We applied MultiCoLA to a 454 massively parallel tag sequencing data set of V6 ribosomal sequences from marine microbes in temperate coastal sands. Consistent ecological patterns were maintained after removing up to 35-40% rare sequences and similar patterns of beta diversity were observed after denoising the data set by using a preclustering algorithm of 454 flowgrams. This example validates the importance of exploring the impact of the definition of rarity in large community data sets. Future applications can be foreseen for data sets from different types of habitats, e.g. other marine environments, soil and human microbiota.},

They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

abstract = {The biodegradability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (tDOM) exported to the sea has a major impact on the global carbon cycle, but our understanding of tDOM bioavailability is fragmentary. In this study, the effects of preparative tDOM isolation on microbial decomposition were investigated in incubation experiments consisting of mesocosms containing mesohaline water from the Baltic Sea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) consumption, molecular DOM composition, bacterial activities, and shifts in bacterial community structure were compared between mesocosms supplemented with riverine tDOM, either as filtered, particle-free river water or as a concentrate obtained by lyophilization/tangential ultrafiltration, and those containing only Baltic Sea water or river water. As shown using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry (15 Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) covering approximately 4600 different DOM compounds, the three DOM preparation protocols resulted in distinct patterns of molecular DOM composition. However, despite DOC losses of 4-16% and considerable bacterial production, there was no significant change in DOM composition during the 28-day experiment. Moreover, tDOM addition affected neither DOC degradation nor bacterial dynamics significantly, regardless of the tDOM preparation. This result suggested that the introduced tDOM was largely not bioavailable, at least on the temporal scale of our experiment, and that the observed bacterial activity and DOC decomposition mainly reflected the degradation of unknown, labile, colloidal and low-molecular weight DOM, both of which escape the analytical window of FT-ICR-MS. In contrast to the different tDOM preparations, the initial bacterial inoculum and batch culture conditions determined bacterial community succession and superseded the effects of tDOM addition. The uncoupling of tDOM and bacterial dynamics suggests that mesohaline bacterial communities cannot efficiently utilize tDOM and that in subarctic estuaries other factors are responsible for the removal of imported tDOM.},

abstract = {Diversity begets higher-order properties such as functional stability and robustness in microbial communities, but principles that inform conceptual (and eventually predictive) models of community dynamics are lacking. Recent work has shown that selection as well as dispersal and drift shape communities, but the mechanistic bases for assembly of communities and the forces that maintain their function in the face of environmental perturbation are not well understood. Conceptually, some interactions among community members could generate endogenous dynamics in composition, even in the absence of environmental changes. These endogenous dynamics are further perturbed by exogenous forcing factors to produce a richer network of community interactions and it is this 'system' that is the basis for higher-order community properties. Elucidation of principles that follow from this conceptual model requires identifying the mechanisms that (a) optimize diversity within a community and (b) impart community stability. The network of interactions between organisms can be an important element by providing a buffer against disturbance beyond the effect of functional redundancy, as alternative pathways with different combinations of microbes can be recruited to fulfill specific functions.},

However, until very recently we have not been able to identify microbes and record their mostly invisible activities, such as nutrient consumption or toxin production on the level of the single cell, not even in the laboratory. This is now changing with the rapid rise of exciting new technologies for single-cell microbiology (1, 2), which enable microbiologists to do what plant and animal ecologists have been doing for a long time: observe who does what, when, where, and next to whom. Single cells taken from the environment can be identified and even their genomes sequenced. Ex situ, their size, elemental, and biochemical composition, as well as other characteristics can be measured with high-throughput and cells sorted accordingly. Even better, individual microbes can be observed in situ with a range of novel microscopic and spectroscopic methods, enabling localization, identification, or functional characterization of cells in a natural sample, combined with detecting uptake of labeled compounds. Alternatively, they can be placed into fabricated microfluidic environments, where they can be positioned, exposed to stimuli, monitored, and their interactions controlled ?in microfluido.? By introducing genetically engineered reporter cells into a fabricated landscape or a microcosm taken from nature, their reproductive success or activity can be followed, or their sensing of their local environment recorded.},

Beta diversity—the turnover of community composition in space and time—has received particular attention. Here, I discuss recent findings in spatial and temporal turnover along abiotic and biotic gradients at two different extents. Turnover in space and time seem to exhibit similar scale dependency along latitudinal gradients; turnover is faster in the tropics at narrow study extents, but the pattern is reversed at broad extents as turnover accelerates nearer to the poles. Moreover, organisms at high trophic positions have higher turnover rates in space at broad study extents than do organisms at low trophic positions, but trophic position does not affect temporal turnover rates. Future studies that simultaneously examine variation in community composition in space, time, and along environmental gradients would shed more light on the mechanistic basis of community organization.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long studied the temporal dynamics of plant and animal communities with much less attention paid to the temporal dynamics exhibited by microbial communities. As a result, we do not know if overarching temporal trends exist for microbial communities or if changes in microbial communities are generally predictable with time. Using microbial time series assessed via high-throughput sequencing, we conducted a meta-analysis of temporal dynamics in microbial communities, including 76 sites representing air, aquatic, soil, brewery wastewater treatment, human-and plant-associated microbial biomes. We found that temporal variability in both within-and between-community diversity was consistent among microbial communities from similar environments. Community structure changed systematically with time in less than half of the cases, and the highest rates of change were observed within ranges of 1 day to 1 month for all communities examined. Microbial communities exhibited species–time relationships (STRs), which describe the accumulation of new taxa to a community, similar to those observed previously for plant and animal communities, suggesting that STRs are remarkably consistent across a broad range of taxa. These results highlight that a continued integration of microbial ecology into the broader field of ecology will provide new insight into the temporal patterns of microbial and 'macro'-bial communities alike.},

@article{Sul2013,
abstract = {The microbial cosmopolitan dispersion hypothesis often invoked to explain distribution patterns driven by high connectivity of oceanographic water masses and widespread dispersal ability has never been rigorously tested. By using a global marine bacterial dataset and iterative matrix randomization simulation, we show that marine bacteria exhibit a significantly greater dispersal limitation than predicted by our null model using the "everything is everywhere" tenet with no dispersal limitation scenario. Specifically, marine bacteria displayed bipolar distributions (i.e., species occurring exclusively at both poles and nowhere else) significantly less often than in the null model. Furthermore, we observed fewer taxa present in both hemispheres but more taxa present only in a single hemisphere than expected under the null model. Each of these trends diverged further from the null expectation as the compared habitats became more geographically distant but more environmentally similar. Our meta-analysis supported a latitudinal gradient in bacterial diversity with higher richness at lower latitudes, but decreased richness toward the poles. Bacteria in the tropics also demonstrated narrower latitudinal ranges at lower latitudes and relatively larger ranges in higher latitudes, conforming to the controversial macroecological pattern of the "Rapoport rule." Collectively, our findings suggest that bacteria follow biogeographic patterns more typical of macroscopic organisms, and that dispersal limitation, not just environmental selection, likely plays an important role. Distributions of microbes that deliver critical ecosystem services, particularly those in polar regions, may be vulnerable to the same impacts that environmental stressors, climate warming, and degradation in habitat quality are having on biodiversity in animal and plant species.},

abstract = {In all ecosystems, bacteria are the most numerous organisms and through them flows a large fraction of annual primary production. In the past decade we have learned a great deal about some of the factors that regulate bacteria and their activities, and how these activities, in turn, alter ecosystem-level processes. Here I review three areas in which recent progress has been made with particular reference to pelagic ecosystems: the problem of bacterial cell dormancy; the effect of solar radiation on organic matter lability; and, the maintenance of net heterotrophy. In a system in which grazing is the major source of mortality for bacteria, bacterial cell dormancy is something of a paradox. I argue that the degree to which bacteria are grazed by flagellates (highly selective grazers) versus other grazers (cladocerans, bivalves) may explain the degree and variation in the proportion of active cells which recent evidence shows to be large. Another factor affecting bacterial activity that has come to the fore in recent years is solar radiation. Irradiation, especially in the ultra-violet range has long been thought of as simply deleterious to some bacteria. A wealth of newer evidence shows that refractory dissolved organic compounds may be converted into microbially labile compounds by solar radiation in several wavebands. This interaction between irradiation and organic matter (photolysis) may explain, in part, how dissolved organic carbon (C) may be refractory in the dark environment of the soil but become labile in the illumunated surface waters of lakes or rivers. The newer evidence shows that aquatic ecosystems, at least oligotrophic ones, are significantly subsidized by terrestrially-produced organic matter. I review here multiple lines of evidence that suggest that freshwater ecosystems are predominantly systems which respire more organic C than they produce by photosynthesis, and are therefore net heterotrophic. While net heterotrophy is an interesting exception for terrestrial ecosystems, it appears to be commonplace for aquatic systems and represents an important linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The introduction of total prostate specific antigen (total PSA) testing in blood has revolutionized the detection and management of men with prostate cancer (PCa). The objective of this review was to discuss the challenges of PCa biomarker research, definition of the type of PCa biomarkers, the statistical considerations for biomarker discovery and validation, and to review the literature regarding total PSA velocity and novel blood-based biomarkers. METHODS: An English-language literature review of the Medline database (1990 to August 2010) of published data on blood-based biomarkers and PCa was undertaken. RESULTS: The inherent biological variability of total PSA levels affects the interpretation of any single result. Men who will eventually develop PCa have increased total PSA levels years or decades before the cancer is diagnosed. Total PSA velocity improves predictiveness of total PSA only marginally, limiting its value for PCa screening and prognostication. The combination of PSA molecular forms and other biomarkers improve PCa detection substantially. Several novel blood-based biomarkers such as human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1); interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor (IL-6R) may help PCa diagnosis, staging, prognostication, and monitoring. Panels of biomarkers that capture the biologic potential of PCa are in the process of being validated for PCa prognostication. CONCLUSIONS: PSA is a strong prognostic marker for long-term risk of clinically relevant cancer. However, there is a need for novel biomarkers that aid clinical decision making about biopsy and initial treatment. There is no doubt that progress will continue based on the integrated collaboration of researchers, clinicians and biomedical firms.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers transport dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial environment to downstream ecosystems. In light of climate and global change it is crucial to understand the temporal dynamics of DOM concentration and composition, and its export fluxes from headwaters to larger downstream ecosystems. We monitored DOM concentration and composition based on a diurnal sampling design for 3 years in an Alpine headwater stream. We found hydrologic variability to control DOM composition and the coupling of DOM dynamics in the streamwater and the hyporheic zone. High-flow events increased DOM inputs from terrestrial sources (as indicated by the contributions of humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence), while summer baseflow enhanced the autochthonous imprint of DOM. Diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM composition were likely induced by biological processes linked to temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Floods frequently interrupted diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM, which led to a decoupling of streamwater and hyporheic water DOM composition and delivery of aromatic and humic-like DOM to the streamwater. Accordingly, DOM export fluxes were largely of terrigenous origin as indicated by optical properties. Our study highlights the relevance of hydrologic and seasonal dynamics for the origin, composition and fluxes of DOM in an Alpine headwater stream.},

In the current context of global change, characterizing microbial diversity has become crucial, and new tools have been developed to overcome the methodological challenges posed by working with microbes in nature. The advent of Sanger sequencing and now next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the resolution of microbial communities to an unprecedented degree of precision. However, to correctly interpret microbial diversity and its patterns this revolution must also consider conceptual and methodological matters. This review presents advances, gaps and caveats of these recent approaches when considering microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss potentials and limitations of the available methodologies, from water sampling to sequence analysis, and suggest alternative ways to incorporate results in a conceptual and methodological framework. Together, these methods will allow us to gain an unprecedented understanding of microbial diversity in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {In order to understand the role microbial communities play in mediating ecosys- tem response to disturbances it is essential to address the methodological and conceptual gap that exists between micro- and macro-scale perspectives in ecology. While there is little doubt microorganisms play a central role in ecosystem functioning and therefore in ecosystem response to global change-induced disturbance, our ability to investigate the exact nature of that role is limited by disciplinary and methodological differences among microbial and ecosystem ecologists. In this paper we present results from an interdisciplinary graduate-level seminar class focused on this topic. Through the medium of case studies in global change ecology (soil respiration, nitrogen cycling, plant species invasion and land use/cover change) we highlight differences in our respective approach to ecology and give examples where disciplinary perspective influences our interpretation of the system under study. Finally, we suggest a model for integrating perspectives that may lead to greater interdisciplinary collaboration and enhanced conceptual and mechanistic modeling of ecosystem response to disturbance.},

abstract = {There is a vivid debate on the relative importance of local and regional factors in shaping microbial communities, and on whether microbial organisms show a biogeographic signature in their distribution. Taking a metacommunity approach, spatial factors can become important either through dispersal limitation (compare large spatial scales) or mass effects (in case of strongly connected systems). We here analyze two datasets on bacterial communities [characterized by community fingerprinting through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] in meso- to eutrophic shallow lakes to investigate the importance of spatial factors at three contrasting scales. Variation partitioning on datasets of both the bacterial communities of 11 shallow lakes that are part of a strongly interconnected and densely packed pond system <1 km apart, three groups of shallow lakes approximately 100 km apart, as well as these three groups of shallow lakes combined that span a large part of a North-South gradient in Europe (>2,500 km) shows a strong impact of local environmental factors on bacterial community composition, with a marginal impact of spatial distance. Our results indicate that dispersal is not strongly limiting even at large spatial scales, and that mass effects do not have a strong impact on bacterial communities even in physically connected systems. We suggest that the fast population growth rates of bacteria facilitate efficient species sorting along environmental gradients in bacterial communities over a very broad range of dispersal rates.},

abstract = {Niche and neutral processes drive community assembly and metacommunity dynamics, but their relative importance might vary with the spatial scale. The contribution of niche processes is generally expected to increase with increasing spatial extent at a higher rate than that of neutral processes. However, the extent to what community composition is limited by dispersal (usually considered a neutral process) over increasing spatial scales might depend on the dispersal capacity of composing species. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the distribution and diversity of species known to have great powers of dispersal (hundreds of kilometres), we analysed the relative importance of niche processes and dispersal limitation in determining beta-diversity patterns of aquatic plants and cladocerans over regional (up to 300 km) and continental (up to 3300 km) scales. Both taxonomic groups were surveyed in five different European regions and presented extremely high levels of beta-diversity, both within and among regions. High beta-diversity was primarily explained by species replacement (turnover) rather than differences in species richness (i.e. nestedness). Abiotic and biotic variables were the main drivers of community composition. Within some regions, small-scale connectivity and the spatial configuration of sampled communities explained a significant, though smaller, fraction of compositional variation, particularly for aquatic plants. At continental scale (among regions), a significant fraction of compositional variation was explained by a combination of spatial effects (exclusive contribution of regions) and regionally-structured environmental variables. Our results suggest that, although dispersal limitation might affect species composition in some regions, aquatic plant and cladoceran communities are not generally limited by dispersal at the regional scale (up to 300 km). Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas.},

Still, a conceptual understanding of the relative importance of the two types of factors is lacking. For instance, it is unknown which sources of dispersal are most important and under which cir- cumstances. Here, we investigated the seasonal variation in the importance of dispersal from different sources (mixing, precipitation, surface runoff and sediment resuspension) for lake bacterioplankton community and population dynamics. For that pur- pose, two small forest lakes and their dispersal sources were sampled over a period of 10 months. The influence of dispersal on communities and popu- lations was determined by 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and SourceTracker analysis. On the com- munity level direct effects of dispersal were questionable from all sources. Instead we found that the community of the preceding sampling occasion, representing growth of resident bacteria, was of great importance. On the population level, however, dis- persal of individual taxa from the inlet could be occasionally important even under low water flow. The effect of sediment resuspension and precipita- tion appeared small.},

abstract = {Despite their homogeneous appearance, aquatic systems harbor heterogeneous habitats resulting from nutrient gradients, suspended particulate matter, and stratification. Recent reports suggest phylogenetically conserved habitat preferences among bacterioplankton, particularly for particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) habitats. Here, we show that independent of lake nutrient level and layer, PA and FL abundance-weighted bacterial community composition (BCC) differed and that inter-lake BCC varied more for PA than FL fractions. In low-nutrient lakes, BCC differences between PA and FL fractions were larger than between lake layers. The reverse was true for high-nutrient lakes. Nutrient level affected BCC more in hypolimnia than in epilimnia, likely due to hypolimnetic hypoxia in high-nutrient lakes. In line with previous reports, we observed within-phylum OTU habitat preference conservation, though not for all phyla, including the phylum with the highest average relative abundance across all habitats (Bacteroidetes). Consistent phylum level habitat preferences may indicate that the functional traits that underpin ecological adaptation of freshwater bacteria to lake habitats can be phylogenetically conserved, though levels of conservation are phylum-dependent. Resolving taxa preferences for freshwater habitats sets the stage for identification of traits that underpin habitat specialization and associated functional traits that influence differences in biogeochemical cycling across freshwater lake habitats.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from chronic bacterial lung infections that lead to death in the majority of cases. The need to maintain lung function in these patients means that characterising these infections is vital. Increasingly, culture-independent analyses are expanding the number of bacterial species associated with CF respiratory samples; however, the potential significance of these species is not known. Here, we applied ecological statistical tools to such culture-independent data, in a novel manner, to partition taxa within the metacommunity into core and satellite species. Sputa and clinical data were obtained from 14 clinically stable adult CF patients. Fourteen rRNA gene libraries were constructed with 35 genera and 82 taxa, identified in 2139 bacterial clones. Shannon-Wiener and taxa-richness analyses confirmed no undersampling of bacterial diversity. By decomposing the distribution using the ratio of variance to the mean taxon abundance, we partitioned objectively the species abundance distribution into core and satellite species. The satellite group comprised 67 bacterial taxa from 33 genera and the core group, 15 taxa from 7 genera (including Pseudomonas (1 taxon), Streptococcus (2), Neisseria (2), Catonella (1), Porphyromonas (1), Prevotella (5) and Veillonella (3)], the last four being anaerobes). The core group was dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other recognised CF pathogens were rare. Mantel and partial Mantel tests assessed which clinical factors influenced the composition observed. CF transmembrane conductance regulator genotype and antibiotic treatment correlated with all core taxa. Lung function correlated with richness. The clinical significance of these core and satellite species findings in the CF lung is discussed. GenBank accession numbers: FM995625–FM997761},

abstract = {Extracellular DNA from dead microorganisms can persist in soil for weeks to years1–3. Although it is implicitly assumed that the microbial DNA recovered from soil predominantly represents intact cells, it is unclear how extracellular DNA affects molecu- lar analyses of microbial diversity. We examined a wide range of soils using viability PCR based on the photoreactive DNA- intercalating dye propidium monoazide4. We found that, on average, 40% of both prokaryotic and fungal DNA was extra- cellular or from cells that were no longer intact. Extracellular DNA inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal richness by up to 55% and caused significant misestimation of taxon rela- tive abundances, including the relative abundances of taxa inte- gral to key ecosystem processes. Extracellular DNA was not found in measurable amounts in all soils; it was more likely to be present in soils with low exchangeable base cation concen- trations, and the effect of its removal on microbial community structure was more profound in high-pH soils. Together, these findings imply that this ‘relic DNA' remaining in soil after cell death can obscure treatment effects, spatiotemporal patterns and relationships between microbial taxa and environmental conditions.},

However, we know relatively little about the forces shaping their large-scale ecological ranges. Here, we reveal patterns in the distribution of individual bacterial taxa at multiple levels of phylogenetic resolution within and between Earth's major habitat types. Our analyses suggest that while macro-scale habitats structure bacterial distribution to some degree, abundant bacteria (i.e. detectable using 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods) are confined to single assemblages. Additionally, we show that the most cosmopolitan taxa are also the most abundant in individual assemblages. These results add to the growing body of data that support that the diversity of the overall bacterial metagenome is tremendous. The mechanisms governing microbial distribution remain poorly understood, but our analyses provide a framework with which to test the importance of macro-ecological environmental gradients, relative abundance, neutral processes and the ecological strategies of individual taxa in structuring microbial communities.},

abstract = {Relative abundance profiles of bacterial populations measured by sequencing DNA or RNA of marker genes can widely differ. These differences, made apparent when calculating ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios, have been interpreted as variable activities of bacterial populations. However, inconsistent correlations between ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios and metabolic activity or growth rates have led to a more conservative interpretation of this metric as the cellular protein synthesis potential (PSP). Little is known, particularly in freshwater systems, about how PSP varies for specific taxa across temporal and spatial environmental gradients and how conserved PSP is across bacterial phylogeny. Here, we generated 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using simultaneously extracted DNA and RNA from fractionated (free-living and particulate) water samples taken seasonally along a eutrophic freshwater estuary to oligotrophic pelagic transect in Lake Michigan. In contrast to previous reports, we observed frequent clustering of DNA and RNA data from the same sample. Analysis of the overlap in taxa detected at the RNA and DNA level indicated that microbial dormancy may be more common in the estuary, the particulate fraction, and during the stratified period. Across spatiotemporal gradients, PSP was often conserved at the phylum and class levels. PSPs for specific taxa were more similar across habitats in spring than in summer and fall. This was most notable for PSPs of the same taxa when located in the free-living or particulate fractions, but also when contrasting surface to deep, and estuary to Lake Michigan communities. Our results show that community composition assessed by RNA and DNA measurements are more similar than previously assumed in freshwater systems. However, the similarity between RNA and DNA measurements and taxa-specific PSPs that drive community-level similarities are conditional on spatiotemporal factors.},

abstract = {Here we used flow cytometry (FCM) and filtration paired with amplicon sequencing to determine the abundance and composition of small low nucleic acid (LNA)-content bacteria in a variety of freshwater ecosystems. We found that FCM clusters associated with LNA-content bacteria were ubiquitous across several ecosystems, varying from 50 to 90% of aquatic bacteria. Using filter-size separation, we separated small LNA-content bacteria (passing 0.4 µm filter) from large bacteria (captured on 0.4 µm filter) and characterized communities with 16S amplicon sequencing. Small and large bacteria each represented different sub-communities within the ecosystems' community. Moreover, we were able to identify individual operational taxonomical units (OTUs) that appeared exclusively with small bacteria (434 OTUs) or exclusively with large bacteria (441 OTUs). Surprisingly, these exclusive OTUs clustered at the phylum level, with many OTUs appearing exclusively with small bacteria identified as candidate phyla (i.e. lacking cultured representatives) and symbionts. We propose that LNA-content bacteria observed with FCM encompass several previously characterized categories of bacteria (ultramicrobacteria, ultra-small bacteria, candidate phyla radiation) that share many traits including small size and metabolic dependencies on other microorganisms.},

abstract = {Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy used by a variety of organisms to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions. By entering a reversible state of low metabolic activity, dormant individuals become members of a seed bank, which can determine community dynamics in future generations. Although microbiologists have documented dormancy in both clinical and natural settings, the importance of seed banks for the diversity and functioning of microbial communities remains untested. Here, we develop a theoretical model demonstrating that microbial communities are structured by environmental cues that trigger dormancy. A molecular survey of lake ecosystems revealed that dormancy plays a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than eukaryotic microbial communities. The proportion of dormant bacteria was relatively low in productive ecosystems but accounted for up to 40% of taxon richness in nutrient-poor systems. Our simulations and empirical data suggest that regional environmental cues and dormancy synchronize the composition of active communities across the landscape while decoupling active microbes from the total community at local scales. Furthermore, we observed that rare bacterial taxa were disproportionately active relative to common bacterial taxa, suggesting that microbial rank-abundance curves are more dynamic than previously considered. We propose that repeated transitions to and from the seed bank may help maintain the high levels of microbial biodiversity that are observed in nearly all ecosystems.},

abstract = {The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects of terrestrial inputs on aquatic bacterial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in relative abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active bacterial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in relative abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies bacterial community stability through functional not structural changes. Together, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones) have enhanced biogeochemical activity, but assembly processes governing subsur- face microbiomes remain a critical uncertainty in understanding hyporheic biogeochemistry. To address this obstacle, we investigated (a) biogeo- graphical patterns in attached and waterborne microbiomes across three hydrologically-connected, physicochemically-distinct zones (inland hyporheic, nearshore hyporheic and river); (b) assembly pro- cesses that generated these patterns; (c) groups of organisms that corresponded to deterministic changes in the environment; and (d) correlations between these groups and hyporheic metabolism. All microbiomes remained dissimilar through time, but consistent presence of similar taxa suggested dis- persal and/or common selective pressures among zones. Further, we demonstrated a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly in all microbiomes as well as seasonal shifts from heterotrophic to auto- trophic microorganisms associated with increases in groundwater discharge. The abundance of one statis- tical cluster of organisms increased with active biomass and respiration, revealing organisms that may strongly influence hyporheic biogeochemistry. Based on our results, we propose a conceptualization of hyporheic zone metabolism in which increased organic carbon concentrations during surface water intrusion support heterotrophy, which succumbs to autotrophy under groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to enhance microbially-explicit ecosystem models describing hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and its influence over riverine ecosystemfunction.},

abstract = {The different drainage basins of large rivers such as the Mississippi River represent interesting systems in which to study patterns in freshwater microbial biogeography. Spatial variability in bacterioplankton communities in six major rivers (the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas) of the Mississippi River Basin was characterized using Ion Torrent 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. When all systems were combined, particle-associated (>3 micron) bacterial assemblages were different from free-living bacterioplankton in terms of overall community structure, partly because of differences in the proportional abundance of sequences affiliated with major bacterial lineages (Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes). Both particle-associated and free-living communities ordinated by river system, a pattern that was apparent even after rare sequences or those affiliated with Cyanobacteria were removed from the analyses. Ordination of samples by river system correlated with environmental characteristics of each river, such as nutrient status and turbidity. Communities in the Upper Mississippi and the Missouri, and the Ohio and the Tennessee, pairs of rivers that join each other, contained similar taxa in terms of presence/absence data, but differed in the proportional abundance of major lineages. The most common sequence types detected in particle-associated communities were picocyanobacteria in the Syn/Pro clade, while free-living communities also contained a high proportion of LD12 (SAR11/Pelagibacter)-like Alphaproteobacteria. This research shows that while different tributaries of large river systems such as the Mississippi River harbor distinct bacterioplankton communities, there is also microhabitat variation such as that between free-living and particle-associated assemblages.},

abstract = {The Danube River is the second longest river in Europe, and its bacterial community composition has never been studied before over its entire length. In this study, bacterial community composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified portions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a total of 98 stations on the Danube River (73 stations) and its major tributaries (25 stations), covering a distance of 2,581 km. Shifts in the bacterial community composition were related to changes in environmental conditions found by comparison with physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature and concentration of nutrients) and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a). In total, 43 distinct DGGE bands were detected. Sequencing of selected bands revealed that the phylotypes were associated with typical freshwater bacteria. Apparent bacterial richness in the Danube varied between 18 and 32 bands and correlated positively with the concentration of P-PO(4) (r = 0.56) and negatively with Chl a (r = -0.52). An artificial neural network-based model explained 90% of the variation of apparent bacterial richness using the concentrations of N-NO(2) and P-PO(4) and the distance to the Black Sea as input parameters. Between the cities of Budapest and Belgrade, apparent bacterial richness was significantly lower than that of other regions of the river, and Chl a showed a pronounced peak. Generally, the bacterial community composition developed gradually; however, an abrupt and clear shift was detected in the section of the phytoplankton bloom. Large impoundments did not have a discernible effect on the bacterial community of the water column. In conclusion, the riverine bacterial community was largely influenced by intrinsic factors.},

We quantify the role of neutral processes by simulating division, mutation, and death of 100,000 individual marine bacteria cells with full 1 million-base-pair genomes in a global surface ocean circulation model. The model is run for up to 100,000 years and output is analyzed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) alignment and metagenomics fragment recruitment. Simulations show the production and maintenance of biogeographic patterns, characterized by distinct provinces subject to mixing and periodic takeovers by neighbors (coalescence), after which neutral evolution reestablishes the province and the patterns reorganize. The emergent patterns are substantial (e.g., down to 99.5% DNA identity between North and Central Pacific provinces) and suggest that microbes evolve faster than ocean currents can disperse them. This approach can also be used to explore environmental selection.},

abstract = {Rivers make vital contributions to the transport of water, sediment and nutrients from terrestrial to marine ecosystems. However, many large rivers worldwide are suffering from dam regulation. Increasing attention has been paid to bacterioplankton communities since they are highly responsive to river alterations and may influence biogeochemical processes. Here, a comprehensive study was conducted in the highly regulated Lancang–Mekong River Basin to address the question of how bacterioplankton communities respond to cascade damming. The results showed that dam constructions increased nutrient concentrations and threatened water quality in cascade reservoirs. Bacterioplankton cell abundance was reduced by damming, and $\alpha$-diversity was inhibited in cascade reservoirs. Fortunately, however, river ecosystems were resilient after the remarkable disturbance caused by damming. Moreover, bacterioplankton community composition was significantly altered by cascade dams, including a shift in the dominant phylum from r-strategists to k-strategists. Meanwhile, according to GeoChip analysis, the functional composition of bacterioplankton was less affected than taxonomic composition. In addition, geographic and environmental features both followed a distance–decay relationship with community and functional composition, but the local environment condition was the dominant driver in the Lancang River. Therefore, the impoundments of cascade dams had significant impacts on bacterioplankton communities and more attention should be paid to the potential ecological consequences of river regulation. {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Cystophloroketals A−E(1−5), five new phloroglucinol−meroditerpenoid hybrids, have been isolated together with their putative biosynthetic precursor, the monocyclic meroditerpenoid 6, from the Mediterranean brown alga Cystoseira tamariscifolia. They represent the first examples of meroditerpenoids linked to a phloroglucinol through a 2,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety. The chemical structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis (HR-ESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and ECD) and TDDFT ECD calculations. Compounds 1−6 were tested for their antifouling activity against several marine colonizing species (bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, micro- and macroalgae). Compound 6 showed high potency for the inhibition of macrofoulers (invertebrates and macroalgae), while cystophloroketals B (2) and D (4) displayed strong inhibition of the germination of the two macroalgae tested and moderate antimicrobial activities (bacteria, microalgae, and fungi). n},

Using activated sludge as a model system, we utilized the intensive longitudinal sampling method to identify overlooked diversity and the hidden dynamics of microbes, detect cross-associations among microbes after detrending, and reveal the central microbial dynamics during sludge bulking and foaming. We discovered that the accumulative alpha diversity in activated sludge sampled daily over 392 days could be as high as 14 000 OTUs, and that the bacterial community dynamics followed a gradual succession, drifting away from the initial observed day and displaying a significant time-dependent trend. Cross-associations among bacteria were modulated after removing potential spurious correlations based on autocorrelation in microbial time series.

abstract = {We examined bacterioplankton community composition (BCC; using polymerase chain reaction-based phylogenetic fingerprinting) and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM; using scanning fluorometry) within lake chains in high-elevation catchments of the Sierra Nevada, California. We compared temporal BCC dynamics in two connected cirque lakes and their inlets and found that lake : inlet community similarity of both lakes declined with increasing residence time because of seasonal snowpack melting. However, for over 3 yr the headwater lake remained distinct from its inlet even during peak snowmelt (residence time <5 d), whereas the downstream lake was consistently similar to both its inlet and the upstream lake. We subsequently sampled 17 lake chains (4–8 lakes each) throughout the Sierra Nevada longitudinally to examine how landscape position and catchment characteristics influenced the similarity in BCC and DOM among lakes and their connecting streams. Headwater lakes were significantly less similar to their inlet streams than were downstream lakes. BCC was heterogeneous throughout each catchment, but headwater inlet BCC was consistently distinct from all downstream samples. In contrast, DOM exhibited a trend of increasing homogeneity as water moved downstream: upstream and downstream waters were distinct but without clear headwater outliers. The similarity in BCC and DOM between any two lakes within a chain declined with geographic distance. Our results illustrate the contrasting roles of environmental selection and dispersal in structuring bacterioplankton communities, supporting both strong within-lake environmental selection for communities distinct from terrigenous inputs and a weaker effect of geographic dispersal differentiating communities among lakes linked by advective flow.},

@article{Hellweger2009a,
abstract = {The individual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized for some time. However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and other environs, and "digital organisms" and "domesticated computer viruses" in silico. The use of IBM in these applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45%), emergence (24%), absence of a continuum (5%), and other unknown reasons (26%). In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach), modeling agent-agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors). Overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges remain, including simulating various types of agent-agent interactions (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Water entering lakes from the surrounding watershed often delivers large amounts of terrestrial-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that can contribute to aquatic bacterial production. However, research suggests that phytoplankton-derived DOC is more labile than its terrestrial counterpart, owing to microbial processing of terrestrial-derived DOC along its flow path to surface waters. The ratio of water colour (absorbance at 440 nm) to chlorophyll a has been suggested as a simple measure of the relative contribution of terrestrial and aquatic primary production to aquatic secondary production. To explore the correlation between primary DOC source and the occurrence of bacterial taxonomic groups, we conducted a survey of bacterial 16S rRNA gene composition in 15 lakes positioned along a water colour : chlorophyll a gradient. Our goal was to identify bacterial taxa occurrence patterns along the colour : chlorophyll a gradient that may indicate a competitive advantage for bacterial taxa using terrestrial or aquatic carbon. We observed a large number of bacterial taxa occurrence patterns suggestive of carbon substrate niche partitioning, especially when relatively highly resolved taxonomic groups were considered. Our survey supports the hypothesis that bacterial taxa partition along a carbon substrate source gradient and highlights carbon source-bacterial interactions that should be explored further.},

abstract = {Two recent, independent advances in ecology have generated interest and controversy: the development of neutral community models (NCMs) and the extension of biogeographical relationships into the microbial world. Here these two advances are linked by predicting an observed microbial taxa-volume relationship using an NCM and provide the strongest evidence so far for neutral community assembly in any group of organisms, macro or micro. Previously, NCMs have only ever been fitted using species-abundance distributions of macroorganisms at a single site or at one scale and parameter values have been calibrated on a case-by-case basis. Because NCMs predict a malleable two-parameter taxa-abundance distribution, this is a weak test of neutral community assembly and, hence, of the predictive power of NCMs. Here the two parameters of an NCM are calibrated using the taxa-abundance distribution observed in a small waterborne bacterial community housed in a bark-lined tree-hole in a beech tree. Using these parameters, unchanged, the taxa-abundance distributions and taxa-volume relationship observed in 26 other beech tree communities whose sizes span three orders of magnitude could be predicted. In doing so, a simple quantitative ecological mechanism to explain observations in microbial ecology is simultaneously offered and the predictive power of NCMs is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Coastal pelagic environments are believed to feature concentration gradients of dissolved organic carbon at a microscale, and they are characterized by pronounced seasonal differences in substrate availability for the heterotrophic picoplankton. Microbial taxa that coexist in such habitats might thus differ in their ability to incorporate substrates at various concentrations. We investigated the incorporation patterns of leucine in four microbial lineages from the coastal North Sea at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 nM before and during a spring phytoplankton bloom. Community bulk incorporation rates and the fraction of leucine-incorporating cells in the different populations were analyzed. Significantly fewer bacterial cells incorporated the amino acid before (13 to 35%) than during (23 to 47%) the bloom at all but the highest concentration. The incorporation rate per active cell in the prebloom situation was constant above 0.1 nM added leucine, whereas it increased steeply with substrate concentration during the bloom. At both time points, a high proportion of members of the Roseobacter clade incorporated leucine at all concentrations (55 to 80% and 86 to 94%, respectively). In contrast, the fractions of leucine-incorporating cells increased substantially with substrate availability in bacteria from the SAR86 clade (8 to 31%) and from DE cluster 2 of the Flavobacteria-Sphingobacteria (14 to 33%). The incorporation patterns of marine Euryarchaeota were between these extremes (30 to 56% and 48 to 70%, respectively). Our results suggest that the contribution of microbial taxa to the turnover of particular substrates may be concentration dependent. This may help us to understand the specific niches of coexisting populations that appear to compete for the same resources.},

abstract = {Marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) encompasses one of the largest reservoirs of carbon on Earth. Heterotrophic bacteria are the primary biotic force regulating the fate of this material, yet the capacity of individual strains to significantly contribute to carbon cycling is unknown. Here we quantified the ability of a single Alteromonas strain [Alteromonas sp. strain Scripps Institution of Oceanography (AltSIO)] to drawdown ambient DOC in a coastal ecosystem. In three experiments, AltSIO alone consumed the entire pool of labile DOC, defined here as the quantity consumed by the submicron size fraction of ambient microbial assemblages within 5 d. These findings demonstrate that complete removal of the labile DOC pool in coastal surface seawater can be achieved by a single taxon. During long-term incubations (>1 y) testing semilabile DOC consumption, AltSIO entered dormancy but remained viable, while the diverse assemblages continued to consume carbon. Given that AltSIO is a large bacterium and thus subject to increased grazing pressure, we sought to determine the ecological relevance of this phenotype. Growth dynamics in natural seawater revealed that AltSIO rapidly outgrew the native bacteria, and despite intense grazing pressure, was never eliminated from the population. A survey in the California Current Ecosystem revealed that large bacteria (≥40 fg C⋅cell(-1)) were persistent, accounting for up to 12% of total bacterial abundance and 24% of total bacterial biomass. We conclude that large, rapidly growing bacteria have the potential to disproportionately alter the fate of carbon in the mesotrophic ocean and play an important role in ecosystem function.},

abstract = {While the disciplines of oceanography and limnology often operate in isolate, freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems are intricately linked. The emphasis of this special issue for Limnology and Oceanography is on the aquatic continuum and the connectivity between aquatic ecosystems from headwater streams and inland waters, to coastal and marine systems. Changes in the transport and transformation of elements as well as ecological functions occur along this aquatic continuum. Assemblages of organisms change in a way that reflects the ecological and biogeochemical conditions of the aquatic gradient. Here, we highlight research progress in limnology and oceanography across the aquatic continuum and at the interfaces of headwaters to oceans. Contributions explored nutrient and carbon dynamics which included release, transportation, transformation, and stoichiometry from freshwaters to marine. The special issue also explored food web continua, including functional changes, biodiversity gradients, and photosynthesis and respiration comparisons among ecosystems at different points in the continuum. Rapid improvements in biomolecular techniques, use of long-term datasets, applications of novel statistical methods, and improved upscaling methods can transform the way aquatic scientists are describing biological organisms and communities from freshwaters to oceans. One important conclusion is the recognition that anthropogenic activities such as invasive species and nutrient pollution trigger challenge the current concepts of aquatic continua including the river continuum concept, the land to ocean continuum, river to estuary systems, and the submarine groundwater discharge. Both limnologists and oceanographers have much to gain from exchanging information with one another, especially in light of global change.},

Our results show that the response is mediated by complex shifts in community structure, and structural equation analysis confirmed two main pathways, one involving adjustments in the level of activity of existing phylotypes, and the other the replacement of the dominant phylotypes. These contrasting response pathways were not determined by the type or the intensity of the gradients involved, as we had hypothesized, but rather it would appear that some compositional configurations may be intrinsically more plastic than others. Our results suggest that community composition determines this overall level of community plasticity, but that composition itself may be driven by factors independent of the environmental gradients themselves, such that the response of bacterial communities to a given type of gradient may alternate between the adjustment and replacement pathways. We conclude that community composition influences the pathways of response in these bacterial communities, but not the metabolic outcome itself, which is driven by the environment, and which can be attained through multiple alternative configurations.},

abstract = {A major goal of microbial community ecology is to understand the forces that structure community composition. Deterministic selection by specific environmental factors is sometimes important, but in other cases stochastic or ecologically neutral processes dominate. Lacking is a unified conceptual framework aiming to understand why deterministic processes dominate in some contexts but not others. Here we work toward such a framework. By testing predictions derived from general ecological theory we aim to uncover factors that govern the relative influences of deterministic and stochastic processes. We couple spatiotemporal data on subsurface microbial communities and environmental parameters with metrics and null models of within and between community phylogenetic composition. Testing for phylogenetic signal in organismal niches showed that more closely related taxa have more similar habitat associations. Community phylogenetic analyses further showed that ecologically similar taxa coexist to a greater degree than expected by chance. Environmental filtering thus deterministically governs subsurface microbial community composition. More importantly, the influence of deterministic environmental filtering relative to stochastic factors was maximized at both ends of an environmental variation gradient. A stronger role of stochastic factors was, however, supported through analyses of phylogenetic temporal turnover. Although phylogenetic turnover was on average faster than expected, most pairwise comparisons were not themselves significantly non-random. The relative influence of deterministic environmental filtering over community dynamics was elevated, however, in the most temporally and spatially variable environments. Our results point to general rules governing the relative influences of stochastic and deterministic processes across micro-and macro-organisms.},

Comprehensive eval- uations of the controls that molecular structure exerts on organic matter's persistence in the environment have been precluded by organic matter's extreme complexity4 . Here we examine dissolved organic matter from 109 Swedish lakes using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy to investigate the constraints on its persistence in the environment. We find that degradation processes preferentially remove oxidized, aromatic compounds, whereas reduced, aliphatic and N-containing compounds are either resistant to degradation or tightly cycled and thus persist in aquatic systems. The patterns we observe for individual molecules are consistent with our measurements of emergent bulk characteristics of organic matter at wide geographic and temporal scales, as reflected by optical properties. We conclude that intrinsic molecular properties are an important control of overall organic matter reactivity. Dissolved},

abstract = {AIMS: We have previously suggested that acute ethanol consumption by normal subjects decreases the availability of circulating tryptophan (Trp) to the brain by activating liver Trp pyrrolase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the (major) kynurenine pathway of Trp degradation. The aim of the present study was to examine this hypothesis further by measuring plasma levels of kynurenine metabolites following alcohol consumption. METHODS: After an overnight fast and a light breakfast, each of 10 healthy subjects received one of five drinks (placebo and doses of ethanol of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g/kg body weight in tonic water) on five different occasions. Blood samples were withdrawn 2 h later and plasma was analysed for concentrations Trp, competing amino acids (CAA) and kynurenine metabolites. RESULTS: Along with the depletion of plasma Trp and the decrease in its availability to the brain, as expressed by the ratio of [Trp]/[CAA], plasma kynurenine was elevated by doses of ethanol of 0.2-0.8 g/kg body weight. The ratio% of [kynurenine]/[Trp], an index of the expression of Trp pyrrolase activity, was also increased by all doses of ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that activation of liver Trp pyrrolase mediates the depletion of plasma Trp and the decrease in its availability to the brain induced by acute ethanol consumption.},

Theories of species assembly aim to reproduce the empirical joint patterns of specificity and abundance, with the goal to explain patterns of biodiversity across habitats. The specialist-generalist paradigm predicts that specialists should have a local advantage over generalists and thus be more abundant. We developed a specificity index to analyse abundance–specificity relationships in microbial ecosystems. By analysing microbiota spanning 23 habitats from three very different data sets covering a wide range of sequencing depths and environmental conditions, we find that habitats are consistently dominated by specialist taxa, resulting in a strong, positive correlation between abundance and specificity. This finding is consistent over several levels of taxonomic aggregation and robust to errors in abundance measures. The relationship explains why shallow sequencing captures similar $\beta$-diversity as deep sequencing, and can be sufficient to capture the habitat-specific functions of microbial communities.},

Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

abstract = {Bacterioplankton community composition was compared across 10 lakes and 14 streams within the catchment of Toolik Lake, a tundra lake in Arctic Alaska, during seven surveys conducted over three years using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified rDNA. Bacterioplankton communities in streams draining tundra were very different than those in streams draining lakes. Communities in streams draining lakes were similar to communities in lakes. In a connected series of lakes and streams, the stream communities changed with distance from the upstream lake and with changes in water chemistry, suggesting inoculation and dilution with bacteria from soil waters or hyporheic zones. In the same system, lakes shared similar bacterioplankton communities (78% similar) that shifted gradually down the catchment. In contrast, unconnected lakes contained somewhat different communities (67% similar). We found evidence that dispersal influences bacterioplankton communities via advection and dilution (mass effects) in streams, and via inoculation and subsequent growth in lakes. The spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community composition was strongly influenced by interactions among soil water, stream, and lake environments. Our results reveal large differences in lake-specific and stream-specific bacterial community composition over restricted spatial scales (<10 km) and suggest that geographic distance and connectivity influence the distribution of bacterioplankton communities across a landscape.},

We found that the number of rRNA genes correlates with the rate at which phylogenetically diverse bacteria respond to resource availability. Soil bacteria that formed colonies rapidly upon exposure to a nutritionally complex medium contained an average of 5.5 copies of the small subunit rRNA gene, whereas bacteria that responded slowly contained an average of 1.4 copies. In soil microcosms pulsed with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxy- acetic acid (2,4-D), indigenous populations of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria with multiple rRNA genes (x ? ? 5.4) became dominant, whereas populations with fewer rRNA genes (x ? ? 2.7) were favored in unamended controls. These findings demonstrate phenotypic effects associated with rRNA gene copy number that are indicative of ecological strategies influencing the structure of natural microbial communities.},

abstract = {Coastal sands filter and accumulate organic and inorganic materials from the terrestrial and marine environment, and thus provide a high diversity of microbial niches. Sands of temperate climate zones represent a temporally and spatially highly dynamic marine environment characterized by strong physical mixing and seasonal variation. Yet little is known about the temporal fluctuations of resident and rare members of bacterial communities in this environment. By combining community fingerprinting via pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes with the characterization of multiple environmental parameters, we disentangled the effects of seasonality, environmental heterogeneity, sediment depth and biogeochemical gradients on the fluctuations of bacterial communities of marine sands. Surprisingly, only 3-5% of all bacterial types of a given depth zone were present at all times, but 50-80% of them belonged to the most abundant types in the data set. About 60-70% of the bacterial types consisted of tag sequences occurring only once over a period of 1 year. Most members of the rare biosphere did not become abundant at any time or at any sediment depth, but varied significantly with environmental parameters associated with nutritional stress. Despite the large proportion and turnover of rare organisms, the overall community patterns were driven by deterministic relationships associated with seasonal fluctuations in key biogeochemical parameters related to primary productivity. The maintenance of major biogeochemical functions throughout the observation period suggests that the small proportion of resident bacterial types in sands perform the key biogeochemical processes, with minimal effects from the rare fraction of the communities.},

abstract = {The importance of microbial communities (MCs) cannot be overstated. MCs underpin the biogeochemical cycles of the earth's soil, oceans and the atmosphere, and perform ecosystem functions that impact plants, animals and humans. Yet our ability to predict and manage the function of these highly complex, dynamically changing communities is limited. Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology. Here, we argue that addressing this challenge requires close coordination of experimental data collection and method development with mathematical model building. We discuss specific examples where model-experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure. We also highlight key research questions that still demand better integration of experiments and models. We argue that such integration is needed to achieve significant progress in our understanding of MC dynamics and function, and we make specific practical suggestions as to how this could be achieved.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 29 March 2016; doi:10.1038/ismej.2016.45.},

@article{Doolittle1999,
abstract = {From comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding ribosomal RNAs and several proteins, molecular phylogeneticists have constructed a "universal tree of life," taking it as the basis for a "natural" hierarchical classification of all living things. Although confidence in some of the tree's early branches has recently been shaken, new approaches could still resolve many methodological uncertainties. More challenging is evidence that most archaeal and bacterial genomes (and the inferred ancestral eukaryotic nuclear genome) contain genes from multiple sources. If "chimerism" or "lateral gene transfer" cannot be dismissed as trivial in extent or limited to special categories of genes, then no hierarchical universal classification can be taken as natural. Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find the "true tree," not because their methods are inadequate or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but because the history of life cannot properly be represented as a tree. However, taxonomies based on molecular sequences will remain indispensable, and understanding of the evolutionary process will ultimately be enriched, not impoverished.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on the linkages between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria, it is not yet clear how the abundance of the main aquatic clades relates to DOM composition in natural aquatic systems. We evaluated this relation using PARAFAC modeling of excitation–emission fluorescence spectros- copy and spectroscopic indexes to characterize DOM composition, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, to quantify the major bacterial groups in a subtropical lagoon. The DOM exhibited marked temporal variations in concentration, molecular weight, aromaticity, color, degree of humification, and freshness, and proportion of the three different fluorescent components identified. All major bacterial clades (Alphaproteobacteria, Beta- proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria) were significantly linked to DOM concentra- tion and/or composition, being those crucial factors for modeling their abundance in situ. The combination and significance of the factors was specific for each bacterial group, strongly indicating that they behave as coherent and distinctive units. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were the groups which corre- lated with more DOM properties. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria abundances were significantly explained by low or high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, respectively. The significant relationships between DOM properties and the main bacterial groups delineated a profile of each group regarding DOM preferences/dislikes, in agreement with evidence derived from genome analysis to single-cell substrate uptake. These results highlight the specificities of the main bacterial clades, providing support for a functional classi- fication of the bacterioplankton regarding DOM processing at the level of bacterial classes.},

abstract = {Much research has focused on improving ecosystem models by incorporating microbial regulation of biogeochemistry. However, models still struggle to predict biogeochemical function in future scenarios linked to accelerating global environmental change. Ecological mechanisms may influence the relationship between microbial communities and biogeochemistry, and here, we show that stochastic dispersal processes (e.g., wind-driven or hydrologic transport) can suppress biogeochemical function. Microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the balance of these two processes is hypothesized to influence how microbial communities correspond to biogeochemical function. We explore the theoretical basis for this hypothesis and use ecological simulation models to demonstrate potential influences of assembly processes on ecosystem function. We assemble receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community (selection-only, moderate dispersal, and homogenizing dispersal). We then calculate the degree to which assembled individuals are adapted to their environment and relate the level of adaptation to biogeochemical function. We also use ecological null models to further link assembly the level of deterministic assembly to function. We find that dispersal can decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa, outweighing selection. The niche breadth of taxa is also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Together, our results highlight the importance of considering ecological assembly processes to reduce uncertainty in predictions of biogeochemical cycles under future environmental scenarios.},

abstract = {An estimate of microbial production is used as a general index of microbial activity, and specifically, to calculate growth rates. Biomass production is used to obtain a first-order estimate of rates of several processes mediated by microbes. In the case of heterotrophic bacteria, biomass production is used to estimate use of dissolved organic material (DOM) if coupled with an estimate of the growth efficiency. DOM uptake equals bacterial biomass production divided by the growth efficiency (expressed as a fraction, not a percentage). Biomass production is the increase in biomass per unit time per unit volume or per area and is a function of both biomasses (B), usually expressed as carbon mass per volume—for example, $\mu$gC l-1—and the specific growth rate ($\mu$) (e.g.h1). The methods used to examine bacterial production in aquatic environments are either thymidine (TdR) incorporation, or leucine (Leu) incorporation. Both are rapid, easy, and specific for heterotrophic bacteria. This leucine method is discussed, as it is more straightforward than the TdR method for estimating the bacterial production. Two variations of the Leu method are described; however, the basic biochemistry and physiology behind the methods are the same.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations – mainly of terrestrial origin – are increasing worldwide in inland waters. Heterotrophic bacteria are the main consumers of DOC and thus determine DOC temporal dynamics and availability for higher trophic levels. Our aim was to study bacterial carbon (C) turnover with respect to DOC quantity and chemical quality using both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources. We incubated a natural bacterial community with allochthonous C (13C-labeled beech leachate) and increased concentrations and pulses (intermittent occurrence of organic matter input) of autochthonous C (phytoplankton lysate). We then determined bacterial C consumption, activities, and community composition together with the C flow through bacteria using stable C isotopes. The chemical analysis of single sources revealed differences in aromaticity and low- and high-molecular-weight substance fractions (LMWS and HMWS, respectively) between allochthonous and autochthonous C sources. Both DOC sources (allochthonous and autochthonous DOC) were metabolized at a high bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) around 50 %. In treatments with mixed sources, rising concentrations of added autochthonous DOC resulted in a further, significant increase in bacterial DOC consumption of up to 68% when nutrients were not limiting. This rise was accompanied by a decrease in the humic substance (HS) fraction and an increase in bacterial biomass. Changes in DOC concentration and consumption in mixed treatments did not affect bacterial community composition (BCC), but BCC differed in single vs. mixed incubations. Our study highlights that DOC quantity affects bacterial C consumption but not BCC in nutrient-rich aquatic systems. BCC shifted when a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous C was provided simultaneously to the bacterial community. Our results indicate that chemical quality rather than source of DOC per se (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) determines bacterial DOC turnover.},

Molecular formula assignment from mass data is most critical and time-consuming for these samples, and in many cases, several formulas can be determined for the same molecular mass. Therefore, automated procedures are required for an efficient exploitation of the extensive data sets. Here, we revise statements in a recent publication,1 which might result in a misleading impression about our approach of formula assignment in a previous work. We also summarize and categorize existing procedures for formula assignment. In addition, we propose new techniques, which are suitable to be implemented in automated evaluation software. The homologous series approach is extended toward a building block approach that can be applied as a new exclusion criterion for incorrect formula assignments. The examination of stable isotope ratios of individual molecules in natural organic matter can be applied as an additional and intrinsic evaluation for calculated molecular formulas.},

abstract = {(200 words max): Relationships between bacterial community and dissolved organic matter (DOM) include microbial uptake, transformation and secretion, all of which influence DOM composition. In this study, we explore diversity and similarity metrics of dissolved organic molecules (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry) and bacterial communities (tag-sequencing of 16S rRNA genes) along the salinity gradient of the Delaware Estuary (USA). We found that even though mixing, discharge and seasonal changes explained most of the variation in DOM and bacterial communities, there was still a relationship, albeit weak, between the composition of DOM and bacterial communities in the estuary. Overall, many DOM molecular formulas (MFs) and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) reoccurred over years and seasons while the frequency of MF-OTU correlations varied. Diversity based on MFs and OTUs was significantly correlated, decreasing towards the open ocean. However, while the diversity of bacterial OTUs dropped markedly with low salinity, MF diversity decreased strongly only at high salinities. We hypothesize that the different turnover times of DOM and bacteria lead to different abundance distributions of OTUs and MFs. A significant portion of the detected DOM is of a more refractory nature with lifetimes largely exceeding the mixing time of the estuary, while bacterial community turnover times in the Delaware Estuary are estimated at several days.},

Sediment microbes play major roles in riparian ecosystems; however, little is known about their longitudinal distribution pattern and their responses to dam construction, the most sev ere human disturbance in river basins. Here, we investigated the variability of sediment bacterial communities along a large-scale longitudinal gradient and between dam-controlled and dam-affected sites in riparian zone of the Lancang River, China. The abundance, activity and diversity of sediment bacteria gradually increased in a downstream direction, but were significantly lower in the dam-affected sites than in the dam-controlled sites. The bacterial community compositions differed significantly between the upper-middle-reach and downstream sites at all control sites, and also between the dam-affected and dam-controlled sites. In the cascade dam area, the relative importance of spatial distance and environmental heterogeneity for bacterial distribution differed between the dam-controlled and dam-affected sites. Spatial distance was the primary cause of variations in bacterial community in dam-controlled site. By contrast, the environmental heterogeneity had more control over the bacterial communities than did the spatial distance in dam-affected site. Network analysis showed that the bacterial community in the dam-affected sites had lower connectivity and stability when compared with that in dam-controlled sites. These results suggest the distinct variations in sediment bacterial community in dam-affected sites, which could enhance our understanding of potential ecological effects caused by dam construction.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that terrestrial ecosystems are exporting more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems than they did just a few decades ago. This "browning" phenomenon will alter the chemistry, physics, and biology of inland water bodies in complex and difficult-to-predict ways. Experiments provide an opportunity to elucidate how browning will affect the stability and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. However, it is challenging to obtain sources of DOC that can be used for manipulations at ecologically relevant scales. In this study, we evaluated a commercially available source of humic substances ("Super Hume") as an analog for natural sources of terrestrial DOC. Based on chemical characterizations, comparative surveys, and whole-ecosystem manipulations, we found that the physical and chemical properties of Super Hume are similar to those of natural DOC in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, Super Hume attenuated solar radiation in ways that will not only influence the physiology of aquatic taxa but also the metabolism of entire ecosystems. Based on its chemical properties (high lignin content, high quinone content, and low C:N and C:P ratios), Super Hume is a fairly recalcitrant, low-quality resource for aquatic consumers. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that Super Hume can subsidize aquatic food webs through 1) the uptake of dissolved organic constituents by microorganisms, and 2) the consumption of particulate fractions by larger organisms (i.e., Daphnia). After discussing some of the caveats of Super Hume, we conclude that commercial sources of humic substances can be used to help address pressing ecological questions concerning the increased export of terrestrial DOC to aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Uncertainties exist regarding the magnitude of in situ dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing in lotic systems. In addition, little is known about the effects of extreme hydrological events on in-stream DOM retention or release during downriver transport. This study quantified the net in-stream retention/release efficiencies (??) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its humic and protein-like fluorescent fractions along a Mediterranean river during drought, baseflow and flood conditions. High performance size exclusion chromatography was used to describe the apparent size distributions of the humic and protein-like DOM moieties. A snapshot mass balance allowed estimating the ?? values of DOC and humic and protein-like fractions. Significant DOM net retention (?? < 0) was detected during the drought condition and the protein-like fraction was more retained than the humic-like fraction and bulk DOC. In addition, small substances were more efficiently retained than larger substances. DOC retention decreased under baseflow conditions, but it remained significant. The humic and protein-like net efficiencies exhibited high variability, but the net retention were not significant. From a longitudinal perspective, the entire fluvial corridor contributed net retention of DOC and humic and protein-like moieties net retention during drought condition. In contrast, net retention/release efficiencies exhibited spatial variability during baseflow condition. The flood preferentially mobilized large size DOM molecules and the fluvial corridor behaved as a homogeneous passive DOM (?? = 0) conduit. This research highlights the relevance of hydrological extreme events on the magnitude of DOM retention/release mass balance and emphasizes the need to perform measurements during these conditions to quantify the impact of fluvial corridors on DOM fate and transport.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer from inland waters to the atmosphere, known as CO2 evasion, is a component of the global carbon cycle. Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8[thinsp]nature12760-m22jpg2K3825 petagrams of carbon (Pg[thinsp]C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32[thinsp]nature12760-m23jpg2K3425 Pg[thinsp]C[thinsp]yr-1 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1[thinsp]Pg[thinsp]C[thinsp]yr-1 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.},

abstract = {The composition and metabolic capability of bacterioplankton communities were examined over seasonal and spatial gradients and related to the source, composition, and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the blackwater estuary Winyah Bay, Georgetown County, SC, USA and its tributary rivers. Bacterial community composition (BCC) was measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and bacterial metabolic capability (BMC) was measured by defined substrate utilization patterns (Biolog GN2 plates). Spatial patterns were not important, despite the anticipated watershed effects and the well-documented influence of salinity gradients on estuarine bacterioplankton, but DOM, BCC, and BMC all showed varying degrees of temporal patterns; DOM-based groupings differentiated BCC samples better than spatiotemporal categories, but not BMC. BCC was closely related to properties describing DOM composition, particularly those related to DOM source (i.e., cypress swamps vs. in situ phytoplankton production, indicated by chlorophyll a, colored DOM spectral slope, alpha 355/dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and DOC concentration), and to associated physicochemical variables, such as temperature, pH, and salinity. BMC was more strongly related to abiotic factors, such as temperature and dissolved nutrients, as well as to chlorophyll a and percent bioavailable DOC. In contrast with previous studies, BCC and BMC were significantly correlated in this highly heterotrophic estuary, suggesting that DOM source variability may select for specialist phylotypes above a background of generalists. This study, therefore, supports a causative pathway from DOM to BMC to BCC while suggesting that BCC and BMC may be simultaneously influenced by different suites of DOM characteristics and physicochemical parameters.},

abstract = {The hyporheic corridor (HC) encompasses the river–groundwater continuum, where the mixing of groundwater (GW) with river water (RW) in the HC can stimulate biogeochemical activity. Here we propose a novel thermodynamic mechanism underlying this phenomenon and reveal broader impacts on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial ecology. We show that thermodynamically favorable DOC accumulates in GW despite lower DOC concentration, and that RW contains thermodynamically less-favorable DOC, but at higher concentrations. This indicates that GW DOC is protected from microbial oxidation by low total energy within the DOC pool, whereas RW DOC is protected by lower thermodynamic favorability of carbon species. We propose that GW–RW mixing overcomes these protections and stimulates respiration. Mixing models coupled with geophysical and molecular analyses further reveal tipping points in spatiotemporal dynamics of DOC and indicate important hydrology–biochemistry–microbial feedbacks. Previously unrecognized thermodynamic mechanisms regulated by GW–RW mixing may therefore strongly influence biogeochemical and microbial dynamics in riverine ecosystems.},

abstract = {The microbial community dynamics of a functionally stable, well-mixed, methanogenic reactor fed with glucose were analyzed over a 605-day period. The reactor maintained constant pH and chemical oxygen demand removal during this period. Thirty-six rrn clones from each of seven sampling events were analyzed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) for the Bacteria and Archaea domains and by sequence analysis of dominant members of the community. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs), distinguished as unique ARDRA patterns, showed reproducible distribution for three sample replicates. The highest diversity was observed in the Bacteria domain. The 16S ribosomal DNA Bacteria clone library contained 75 OTUs, with the dominant OTU accounting for 13% of the total clones, but just 21 Archaea OTUs were found, and the most prominent OTU represented 50% of the clones from the respective library. Succession in methanogenic populations was observed, and two periods were distinguished: in the first, Methanobacterium formicicum was dominant, and in the second, Methanosarcina mazei and a Methanobacterium bryantii-related organism were dominant. Higher variability in Bacteria populations was detected, and the temporal OTU distribution suggested a chaotic pattern. Although dominant OTUs were constantly replaced from one sampling point to the next, phylogenetic analysis indicated that inferred physiologic changes in the community were not as dramatic as were genetic changes. Seven of eight dominant OTUs during the first period clustered with the spirochete group, although a cyclic pattern of substitution occurred among members within this order. A more flexible community structure characterized the second period, since a sequential replacement of a Eubacterium-related organism by an unrelated deep-branched organism and finally by a Propionibacterium-like species was observed. Metabolic differences among the dominant fermenters detected suggest that changes in carbon and electron flow occurred during the stable performance and indicate that an extremely dynamic community can maintain a stable ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Here we describe a new trait-based model for cellular resource allocation that we use to investigate the relative importance of different drivers for small cell size in phytoplankton. Using the model, we show that increased investment in nonscalable structural components with decreasing cell size leads to a trade-off between cell size, nutrient and light affinity, and growth rate. Within the most extreme nutrient-limited, stratified environments, resource competition theory then predicts a trend toward larger minimum cell size with increasing depth. We demonstrate that this explains observed trends using a marine ecosystem model that represents selection and adaptation of a diverse community defined by traits for cell size and subcellular resource allocation. This framework for linking cellular physiology to environmental selection can be used to investigate the adaptive response of the marine microbial community to environmental conditions and the adaptive value of variations in cellular physiology.},

@article{Khanlou1998,
abstract = {Soil microbial communities have the metabolic and genetic capability to adapt to changing environmental conditions on very short time scales. In this paper we combine biogeochemical and molecular approaches to reveal this potential, showing that microbial biomass can turn over on time scales of days to months in soil, resulting in a succession of microbial communities over the course of a year. This new understanding of the year-round turnover and succession of microbial communities allows us for the first time to propose a temporally explicit N cycle that provides mechanistic hypotheses to explain both the loss and retention of dissolved organic N (DON) and inorganic N (DIN) throughout the year in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, our results strongly support the hypothesis that turnover of the microbial community is the largest source of DON and DIN for plant uptake during the plant growing season. While this model of microbial biogeochemistry is derived from observed dynamics in the alpine, we present several examples from other ecosystems to indicate that the general ideas of biogeochemical fluxes being linked to turnover and succession of microbial communities are applicable to a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Dormancy is a life history trait that may have important implications for linking microbial communities to the functioning of natural and managed ecosystems. Rapid changes in environmental cues may resuscitate dormant bacteria and create pulses of ecosystem activity. In this study, we used heavy-water (H(18) 2O) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify fast-growing bacteria that were associated with pulses of trace gasses (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from different ecosystems [agricultural site, grassland, deciduous forest, and coniferous forest (CF)] following a soil-rewetting event. Irrespective of ecosystem type, a large fraction (69-74%) of the bacteria that responded to rewetting were below detection limits in the dry soils. Based on the recovery of sequences, in just a few days, hundreds of rare taxa increased in abundance and in some cases became dominant members of the rewetted communities, especially bacteria belonging to the Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae. Resuscitation led to dynamic shifts in the rank abundance of taxa that caused previously rare bacteria to comprise nearly 60% of the sequences that were recovered in rewetted communities. This rapid turnover of the bacterial community corresponded with a 5-20-fold increase in the net production of CO2 and up to a 150% reduction in the net production of CH4 from rewetted soils. Results from our study demonstrate that the rare biosphere may account for a large and dynamic fraction of a community that is important for the maintenance of bacterial biodiversity. Moreover, our findings suggest that the resuscitation of rare taxa from seed banks contribute to ecosystem functioning.},

The application of NGS (next-generation sequencing technologies) for 16S analysis has been broadly used for understanding bacterioplankton composition and structure. Most of studies conducted on aquatic ecosystems with 16S NGS have been in seawater and lakes. A few studies using NGS have been conducted in river environments and have suggested the presence of a bacterial seed-bank. We performed 16S highly variable V4 region high-throughput analysis in the Sinos River, which is located in one of most important Brazilian industrial centers. This region has several contrasts in its environmental characteristics, presenting a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication and making it a remarkable study site for observing the dynamics of bacterioplankton. We demonstrated consistent evidence for the existence of a bacterial seed-bank and its longitudinal persistence. Seasonal shifts reinforce the importance of the source of the river in maintaining the bacterial seed-bank that spreads throughout the river. Therefore, the preservation of the source of the river is important not only for hydrologic reasons but also to maintain the microbial composition and the ecological integrity of the river.},

abstract = {Beta-probes are a relatively new tool for tracer kinetic studies in animals. They are highly suited to evaluate new positron emission tomography tracers or measure physiologic parameters at rest and after some kind of stimulation or intervention. In many of these experiments, the knowledge of CBF is highly important. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the method of CBF measurements using a beta-probe and H2 15O. CBF was measured in the barrel cortex of eight rats at baseline and after acetazolamide challenge. Trigeminal nerve stimulation was additionally performed in five animals. In each category, three injections of 250 to 300 MBq H2 15O were performed at 10-minute intervals. Data were analyzed using a standard one-tissue compartment model (K1 = CBF, k2 = CBF/p, where p is the partition coefficient). Values for K1 were 0.35 +/- 0.09, 0.58 +/- 0.16, and 0.49 +/- 0.03 mL x min(-1) x mL(-1) at rest, after acetazolamide challenge, and during trigeminal nerve stimulation, respectively. The corresponding values for k2 were 0.55 +/- 0.12, 0.94 +/- 0.16, and 0.85 +/- 0.12 min(-7), and for p were 0.64 +/- 0.05, 0.61 +/- 0.07, and 0.59 +/- 0.06. The standard deviation of the difference between two successive experiments, a measure for the reproducibility of the method, was 10.1%, 13.0%, and 5.7% for K1, k2, and p, respectively. In summary, beta-probes in conjunction with H2 15O allow the reproducible quantitative measurement of CBF, although some systematic underestimation seems to occur, probably because of partial volume effects.},

@article{Ferrenberg2013,
abstract = {Although recent work has shown that both deterministic and stochastic processes are important in structuring microbial communities, the factors that affect the relative contributions of niche and neutral processes are poorly understood. The macrobiological literature indicates that ecological disturbances can influence assembly processes. Thus, we sampled bacterial communities at 4 and 16 weeks following a wildfire and used null deviation analysis to examine the role that time since disturbance has in community assembly. Fire dramatically altered bacterial community structure and diversity as well as soil chemistry for both time-points. Community structure shifted between 4 and 16 weeks for both burned and unburned communities. Community assembly in burned sites 4 weeks after fire was significantly more stochastic than in unburned sites. After 16 weeks, however, burned communities were significantly less stochastic than unburned communities. Thus, we propose a three-phase model featuring shifts in the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as a function of time since disturbance. Because neutral processes are characterized by a decoupling between environmental parameters and community structure, we hypothesize that a better understanding of community assembly may be important in determining where and when detailed studies of community composition are valuable for predicting ecosystem function.},

@article{Kellerman2014a,
abstract = {Despite the small continental coverage of lakes, they are hotspots of carbon cycling, largely due to the processing of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM). As DOM is an amalgam of heterogeneous compounds comprising gradients of microbial and physicochemical reactivity, the factors influencing DOM processing at the molecular level and the resulting patterns in DOM composition are not well understood. Here we show, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to unambiguously identify 4,032 molecular formulae in 120 lakes across Sweden, that the molecular composition of DOM is shaped by precipitation, water residence time and temperature. Terrestrially derived DOM is selectively lost as residence time increases, with warmer temperatures enhancing the production of nitrogen-containing compounds. Using biodiversity concepts, we show that the molecular diversity of DOM, or chemodiversity, increases with DOM and nutrient concentrations. The observed molecular-level patterns indicate that terrestrially derived DOM will become more prevalent in lakes as climate gets wetter.},

@article{Lapierre2014,
abstract = {<p>Despite the rapidly increasing volume of research on the biological and photochemical degradation of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in aquatic environments, little is known of the large-scale patterns in biologically and photochemically degradable DOC (BDOC and PDOC, respectively) in continental watersheds, and on the links that exist between these two key properties that greatly influence the flow of carbon from continents to oceans. Here we explored the patterns in the concentrations and proportions of BDOC and PDOC across hundreds of boreal lakes, rivers and wetlands spanning a large range of system trophic status and terrestrial influence, and compared the drivers of these two reactive pools of DOC at the landscape level. Using standardized incubations of natural waters, we found that the concentrations of BDOC and PDOC covaried across all systems studied but were nevertheless related to different pools of dissolved organic matter (DOM; identified by fluorescence analyses) in ambient waters. Concentrations of nutrients and protein-like fluorescent DOM (FDOM) explained nearly half of the variation in BDOC, whereas PDOC was exclusively predicted by DOM optical properties, consistent with the photochemical degradability of specific FDOM pools that we experimentally determined. The concentrations of colored DOM (CDOM), which we use here as a proxy of terrestrial influence, almost entirely accounted for the observed relationship between FDOM and the concentrations of both BDOC and PDOC. The concentrations of CDOM and of the putative biolabile fluorescence component shifted from complete decoupling in clear-water environments to strong coupling in darker streams and wetlands. This suggests a baseline autochthonous BDOC pool fueled by internal production that is gradually overwhelmed by land-derived BDOC as terrestrial influence increases across landscape gradients. The importance of land as a major source of both biologically and photochemically degradable DOC for continental watersheds resulted in a partial coupling of those carbon pools in natural freshwaters, despite fundamental contrasts in terms of their composition and regulation.</p>},

@article{Raynaud2014,
abstract = {Despite an exceptional number of bacterial cells and species in soils, bacterial diversity seems to have little effect on soil processes, such as respiration or nitrification, that can be affected by interactions between bacterial cells. The aim of this study is to understand how bacterial cells are distributed in soil to better understand the scaling between cell-to-cell interactions and what can be measured in a few milligrams, or more, of soil. Based on the analysis of 744 images of observed bacterial distributions in soil thin sections taken at different depths, we found that the inter-cell distance was, on average 12.46 µm and that these inter-cell distances were shorter near the soil surface (10.38 µm) than at depth (>18 µm), due to changes in cell densities. These images were also used to develop a spatial statistical model, based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes, to analyse the 2D distribution of cells and construct realistic 3D bacterial distributions. Our analyses suggest that despite the very high number of cells and species in soil, bacteria only interact with a few other individuals. For example, at bacterial densities commonly found in bulk soil (10(8) cells g(-1) soil), the number of neighbours a single bacterium has within an interaction distance of ca. 20 µm is relatively limited (120 cells on average). Making conservative assumptions about the distribution of species, we show that such neighbourhoods contain less than 100 species. This value did not change appreciably as a function of the overall diversity in soil, suggesting that the diversity of soil bacterial communities may be species-saturated. All in all, this work provides precise data on bacterial distributions, a novel way to model them at the micrometer scale as well as some new insights on the degree of interactions between individual bacterial cells in soils.},
